    "content": "ANOVA, meaning Analysis of Variance, is a statistical test that tells us about the differences between the means of two or more independent groups. ANOVA tests are most often used when looking at interaction effects between categorical independent variables and continuous dependent variables. The null and alternative hypothesis of an ANOVA test are: . \\[H_0: \\mu_1 = \\mu_2 = \\ldots = \\mu_n\\] \\[H_1: \\exists i, j : \\mu_i \\neq \\mu_j\\] The null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) states that the means of the different levels are all equal, while the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) states that at least one mean is different than that of the other variables. Common Variations of ANOVA . | One-way ANOVA . | Used to determine relationship between a single variable and the response variable | Example: Looking at student scores on standardized test for all students in a school grouped by grade | . | Two-way ANOVA . | Used when examining two categorical independent variables and their relationship with the dependent variable | Categorized as a type of factorial ANOVA | . | Factorial (N-way) ANOVA . | Test two or more categorical independent variables and their relationships to the dependent variable | Terms N-way and Factorial are often used synonymous to describe testing that involves multiple independent variables and a single dependent variable | Example: Measuring growth rate of plants based on the manipulation of watering frequency and exposure to sunlight | . | .

Disadvantages . | Adding additional variables will increase test complexity and difficulty interpreting results | ANOVA test results only provide limited insight into potential interactions, post hoc tests are often required to gain more robust insight into statistically significant ANOVA results | If the test tells us to reject the null hypothesis of equal means, it may not be clear which variable is having the explanatory effect if comparing multiple groups | Must check assumptions prior to using ANOVA to test data . | Data might not have all characteristics meeting the strict assumptions of ANOVA | . | .

    "content": "The stats package, which comes standard-loaded on an RStudio workspace, includes the function arima, which allows one to estimate an arima model, if they know \\(p,d,\\) and \\(q\\) already. #load data gdp = read.csv(\"https://github.com/LOST-STATS/lost-stats.github.io/raw/source/Time_Series/Data/GDPC1.csv\") gdp_ts = ts(gdp[ ,2], frequency = 4, start = c(1947, 01), end = c(2019, 04)) y = log(gdp_ts)*100 . The output for arima() is a list. Use $coef to get only the AR and MA estimates. Use $model to get the entire estimated model. If you want to see the maximized log-likelihood value, \\(sigma^{2}\\), and AIC, simply run the function on the data: . #estimate an ARIMA(2,1,2) model lgdp_arima = arima(y, c(2,1,2)) #To see maximized log-likelihood value, $sigma^{2}$, and AIC: lgdp_arima #To get only the AR and MA parameter estimates: lgdp_arima$coef #To see the estimated model: lgdp_arima$model . In the example above, we are using an d = 1 ARIMA model, or a ARIMA model with one unit root. As noted above, if we want to manually test a time series for one or more unit roots, we run an Augmented Dicky-Fuller test through the tseries::adf.test() function. Note that the null hypothesis for a Augmented Dicky-Fuller tests is that there is a unit root. # If necessary # install.packages(\"tseries\") # perform an augmented Dicky Fuller test adf.test(y) . In this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that there is at least one unit root in the data. To test for a second unit root, we can run an Augmented Dicky-Fuller test on the first difference of the time series. # ADF test on first difference of the data adf.test(y |&gt; diff()) . We can reject the null hypothesis that there is a unit root in the first difference of the data at the 1% level. This implies that there is only one unit root in the series, and a d = 1 model is best suited for this data. The forecast package includes the ability to auto-select ARIMA models. This is of particular use when one would like to automate the selection of \\(p,q\\), and \\(d\\), without writing their own function. According to David Childers, forecast::auto.arima() takes the following steps: - Use the KPSS to test for unit roots, differencing the series unit stationary - Create likelihood functions at various orders of \\(p,q\\) - Use AIC to choose \\(p,q\\), then estimate via Maxmium Likelihood to select \\(p,q\\) . library(forecast) #Finding optimal parameters for an ARIMA using the previous data lgdp_auto = auto.arima(y) #A seasonal model was selected, with non-seasonal components (p,d,q)=(1,2,1), and seasonal components (P,D,Q)=(2,0,1) . After specifying an ARIMA model, it is often prudent to check the model’s residuals for time dependency. Ideally, there should be no autocorrelation in the residuals. The forecast::checkresiduals() function runs a Ljung-Box test which checks for autocorrelation in a time series (in this case the residuals from our ARIMA model). It also generates a visualization of the residuals . # check the residuals of the autogenerated ARIMA model checkresiduals(lgdp_auto) . The Ljung-Box test and the plot show that there is autocorrelation in the residuals. We can reject the null-hypothesis that there is no autocorrelation at the 1% level. This illustrates that, while auto.arima() is efficient, it is always a good idea to review the model it selects. auto.arima() contains a lot of flexibility. If one knows the value of \\(d\\), it can be passed to the function. Maximum and starting values for \\(p,q,\\) and \\(d\\) can be specified in the seasonal- and non-seasonal cases. If one would like to restrict themselves to a non-seasonal model, or use a different test, these can also be done. Some of these features are demonstrated below. The method for testing unit roots can also be specified. See ?auto.arima or the package documentation for more. # Auto-estimate y, specifying: ## non-seasonal ## Using Augmented Dickey-Fuller rather than KPSS ## d=1 ## p starts at 1 and does not exceed 4 # no drift lgdp_ns &lt;- auto.arima(y, seasonal = F, test = \"adf\", start.p = 1, max.p = 4, allowdrift = F) #An ARIMA(3,1,0) was specified lgdp_ns . The forecast package also contains the ability to simulate ARIMA data given an ARIMA model. Note that the input here should come from either forecast::auto.arima() or forecast::Arima(), rather than stats::arima(). #Simulate data using a non-seasonal ARIMA() arima_222 &lt;- Arima(y, c(2,2,2)) sim_arima &lt;- forecast:::simulate.Arima(arima_222) tail(sim_arima, 20) .

Consequently these models cannot be estimated using OLS alone, unlike AR models. | ARMA models are most commonly estimated using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). One consequence of this is that, given some time series and some specified order \\((p,q)\\), the estimates obtained from the estimated \\(ARMA(p,q)\\) model will vary depending on the type of MLE estimation used. | As is the case in many situations where one is trying to estimate a time-series process, model selection is important. For ARMA models, model selection meaning chosing the number of AR and MA parameters, the \\(p\\) and \\(q\\), for which a coefficient will be estimated. In practice, it is common to estimate several different potential models, then use some criterion to determine which model best fits the time-series. Common criteria used to evaluate ARMA models are the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), also referred to as the Schwarz Information Criterion (SIC). For more information on these and other model selection criteria, see Wikipedia: Model Selection. | Estimating a time series using an ARMA model relies on two assumptions. The first is the standard assumption that we have selected the correct functional form for the time series. In this case, that means assuming that we have selected the correct \\(p\\) and \\(q\\).

    "title": "R",
    "content": "There are many great packages to do animated graphs such as gganimate and plotly. Here we use gganimate and ggplot2 to do animated bar graphs, and gifski to save the results. gganimate has the benefit of being able to animate any graph made in ggplot2. This means that all the other graphs in the Figures section, which use ggplot2 for the R implementations, can be animated using gganimate. # Load in necessary packages library(ggplot2) library(gganimate) library(gifski) library(dplyr) # Load in desired data (gapminder) library(gapminder) . gganimate works by taking standard ggplot2 input and adding a transition_ function which specifies what should change from frame to frame, and how. transition_states() is fairly easy to work with, as it simply takes an ordered variable and transitions from value to value of that variable. Here we use year, and so it will remake the graph for each year, and transition between them. ease_aes() specifies how to smoothly transition between states. graph_data1 &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(continent==\"Oceania\") # first use ggplot for the graph ggplot(graph_data1, aes(x=country, y=gdpPercap, fill=country)) + geom_bar(stat='identity') + theme_bw() + # then set the gganimate, transition_states( # to specify the transition, here we specify year, transition_length = 2, # How long to spend on each transition state_length = 1) + # How long to spend in each state (these are relative values, not numbers of frames) ease_aes('sine-in-out') + # to control easing of aesthetics labs(title = 'GDP per Capita in Year {closest_state}', # title with the timestamp period subtitle = 'Oceania Countries (1952 - 2007)') . anim_save(\"graph1.gif\") # to save the graph as gif . Animation can be a good way to show changes over many groups at once. graph_data &lt;- gapminder %&gt;% filter(continent==\"Americas\") # Plot bar graphs by country, we have 25 countries in the Americas, that hard to interpretation using one graph. # this example shows how gganimate can create a nice animated graph even with that high number of countries graph_2 &lt;- ggplot(graph_data, aes(x=country, y=gdpPercap, fill=country)) + geom_bar(stat='identity') + theme_bw() + # gganimate specific bits: transition_states( year, transition_length = 2, state_length = 1) + ease_aes('sine-in-out')+ theme(axis.text=element_blank(), axis.title.x=element_blank(), legend.position=\"center\", panel.border=element_blank(), axis.title.y=element_text(size=20), axis.text.y = element_text(hjust=1, size=16), axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust=1, size=16), plot.title=element_text(size=25, hjust=0.5, face=\"bold\", colour=\"black\", vjust=1), plot.subtitle=element_text(size=24, hjust=0.5, face=\"italic\", color=\"grey\"), plot.margin = margin(2, 2, 4, 4, \"cm\"))+ labs(title = 'GDP per Capita for Year {closest_state}', # title with the timestamp period subtitle = 'Countries in North and South America (1952 - 2007)') . Here, we’ve saved the graph as an object, so that we can use the animate() function to render it and save it as a GIF. This allows us to adjust animation settings like the number of frames or the frames per second. # The animated sitting, create an image per frame, in this example, we used year so it creates an image for each year animate(graph_2, 100, fps = 20, end_pause=30, width = 1400, height = 1000, renderer = gifski_renderer(\"gganim1.gif\")) . There are many other transition_ functions. One useful option for line plots is transition_reveal(), which reveals only a part of the graph at a time until the entire graph is visible. # Plot North America, here we try line graph by only graph North America countries graph_data3 &lt;- graph_data %&gt;% filter(country %in% c(\"United States\", \"Canada\", \"Mexico\")) # Plot line graph graph_3 &lt;- ggplot(data = graph_data3) + geom_line(mapping = aes(x=year, y=lifeExp, color=country)) + theme_bw() + theme(legend.position = \"right\") + labs(title = 'Life Expectancy in North America (1952 - 2007)')+ transition_reveal(year) + # Reveal data along a given dimension ease_aes('linear') # The values change linearly during tweening graph_3 . anim_save(\"graph_3.gif\") # to save the graph as gif .

Error terms from different time periods of a time series variable being correlated is what we call “serial correlation”. Time series data that exhibits autocorrelation is easier to predict and forecast than data that does not. The process for detecting the presence of serial correlation is fairly straightforward. In effect, you simply check whether a variable is correlated with lagged versions of itself. There are details in that process, but that’s the main idea. The “autocorrelation” function checks the correlation between a variable and different lags of itself, typically presented as a graph. It is common to then look at the correlations (or a plot of them) and see which lag lengths have nonzero correlations. There is also the “partial autocorrelation” function, which in the context of a single varaible looks at the correlation between \\(Y_t\\) and \\(Y_{t-j}\\) while controlling for each of the intermediate lags \\(Y_{t-1}, ..., Y_{t-j+1}\\).

    "content": "Implementations contains multiple subsections, one for each statistical software environment/programming language that the technique can be implemented in. | Implementations should be listed in alphabetical order of software/language. eViews, then Python, then R, then SAS, then Stata, etc. | For each language, include well-commented and as-brief-as-reasonably-possible example code that provides an example of performing the technique. Readers should be able to copy the code and have it run the technique from beginning to end, including steps like loading in data if necessary. See existing pages for examples. | If someone else on the internet has already written a clear, thorough, and general implementation example, then linking to it is perfectly fine! This includes StackOverflow/StackExchange answers, which you can link to using the share button. Extremely long demonstrations for super-complex methods may be better left as links only (perhaps with a tiny example pulled out and put on LOST). If the example is short enough, though, including the example directly in the LOST page is preferable, with link attribution of the source, so readers don’t have to go elsewhere. | Avoid creating a long list of examples showing every variant or optional setting of the technique. Instead, focus on one main example, with variants included only if they are especially important. If you like, you can mention in comments additional useful options/settings the reader might want to look into and what they do. | If the technique requires that a package or library be installed, include the code for installing the package in a comment (or if you are using a language where libraries cannot be installed inside the code, include a comment directing the user to install the library). | If a given language has multiple ways of performing the same technique, ideally report only one “best” method, whatever that might be. If other methods are only different in trivial ways, then you can describe them as being alternatives, but avoid providing examples for them. If other methods are different in important ways, then include an example for each, with text explanations of what is different about them. If two contributors seriously disagree about which way is best, then they’re probably different in some meaningful way so you can include both as long as you can explain what that difference is. | It is fine to add implementations for software that only has a graphical interface rather than code (such as Excel) using screenshots. Be sure to keep images well-cropped and small so they don’t crowd the page. If your graphical instructions are necessarily very long, consider posting them as a blog post somewhere and just put a link to that post in Implementations. | . Images . Images can be added to Implementation sections if relevant, for example if you’re working with GUI-only software, or demonstrating the output of a data visualization technique. How can you add these images? You can upload the images somewhere on the internet that allows image linking, and include the image in your instructions with ![Image](src). Ideally, upload the image directly to the Images/name-of-your-page/ subfolder of whatever directory you’re working in, and link to the images there. Please be sure to add alt text to images for sight-impaired users. Image filenames should make reference to the language used to make them, i.e. python_scatterplot.png. Data . Ideally, the same data set will be uploaded to LOST directly in a format accessible by many languages (like CSV) in the Data/name-of-your-page/ subfolder of whatever directory you’re working in, and then that data can be used for implementation in all languages on the page.

    "content": ". | What techniques are important enough to be their own page? This is a little subjective, but if you’re writing about X, which is a minor option/variant of Y, then you can just include it on the Y page. If X is a different technique or a variant of Y that is used in different circumstances or produces meaningfully different output, then give X its own page. | How should I title my page? Pick a single, concise description of the technique you’re talking about. If there are multiple ways to refer to the technique you’re doing, pick one. You will also need to select a file name, which should be in lower_case_with_underscores.md and you might want to make a bit shorter. So Ordinary Least Squares (Linear Regression) might be the title and H1 heading, and ordinary_least_squares.md might be the file name. | What languages can I include in Implementations? Any language is valid as long as it’s something people actually do statistical analysis in. Don’t include something just because you can (I mean, you can technically do OLS in assembly but is that useful for anyone?), but because you think someone will find it useful. | Should I include the output of my code? For data visualization, yes! Just keep the images relatively small so they don’t crowd the page. See the Implementations section above for how to add images. If your output is not visual, there’s probably no need to include output unless you think that it is especially important for some technique. | How can I discuss what I’m doing with other contributors? Head to the Issues page and find (or post) a thread with the title of the page you’re talking about. | How can I [add an image/link to another LOST page/add an external link/bold text] in the LOST wiki? See the Markdown section above. | I want to contribute but I do not like all the rules and structure on this page. I don’t even want my FAQ entry to be a question. Just let me write what I want. If you have valuable knowledge about statistical techniques to share with people and are able to explain things clearly, I don’t want to stop you. So go for it. Maybe post something in Issues when you’re done and perhaps someone else will help make your page more consistent with the rest of the Wiki.

    "content": ". | When creating a correlation matrix it is important to consider the which type of method for correlation analysis will best meet your needs. While the most common is the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, the Spearman and the Kendall methods are also viable possibilities. The Pearson measures the linear dependence between two variables while Spearman and the Kendall methods use a rank-based, non-parametric correlation test. | Correlation only measures a linear relationship between two variables. Correlation will not pick up on non-linearity, and sometimes the correlation may be zero even when the two variables are clearly related. | As with most kinds of statistical analysis it is important to choose how to deal with missing values in your dataset when creating a correlation matrix. The most common method is to only include complete observations in the correlation test. This is a form of pairwise missing values. Pairwise missing values has an underlying assumption that all missing values are random, which is not necessarily the case. Multiple imputation is in some cases a often a better choice for dealing with missing values. It is just not as straightforward to do. | Thinking more about missing values, there are two approaches to dropping missing values (if that’s what you’re doing). One approach, the complete observations approach, is to drop an observation from all calculations for the entire matrix if it contains any missing values. So in a correlation matrix for the variables \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), and row 1 of the data was missing its \\(C\\) value, it would also be dropped from the calculation of \\(Corr(A,B)\\). This first approach is preferred if you want to understand the correlation structure of an analysis that will drop observations in a similar way, like a covariance matrix or a linear regression. The second approach, the pairwise complete observations approach, is to only drop observations from correlation calculations involving missing data, so row 1 with a missing \\(C\\) value would be dropped from \\(Corr(B,C)\\) and \\(Corr(A,C)\\), but not from \\(Corr(A,B)\\).

Switching to table is a good idea for anything more complex than this, as it’s a very flexible command. bysort game_type: tab player etype *---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *-&gt; game_type = away * * | etype * player | foul free th.. rebound shot turnover violation | Total *----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+---------- * Jordan Farmar | 51 21 48 189 45 2 | 356 * Kobe Bryant | 93 315 213 882 93 3 | 1,599 * Pau Gasol | 78 221 389 513 78 5 | 1,284 *----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+---------- * Total | 222 557 650 1,584 216 10 | 3,239 * *---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- *-&gt; game_type = home * * | etype * player | foul free th.. rebound shot turnover violation | Total *----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+---------- * Jordan Farmar | 48 54 62 200 42 2 | 408 * Kobe Bryant | 87 214 197 737 107 4 | 1,346 * Pau Gasol | 81 202 363 480 70 1 | 1,197 *----------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------+---------- * Total | 216 470 622 1,417 219 7 | 2,951 . tab has a number of options that allow for different kinds of analysis. row calculates the percentage of the row that each cell constitutes. col does the same for columns, and cell works for the overall table. Tests of independence between the two variables can be performed with the chi2 option (among some other available tests; see the help file). ",

    "content": "Economic theory usually suggests other variables that could help to forecast the variable of interest over than itself. When we add other variables and their lags the result is what is known as The Autoregressive Lag (ADL) Model. For example, if we want to predict future changes in inflation, the theory (Phillips Curve) suggests that lagged values of the unemployment rate might be a good predictor. In particular, the method for indicating when one variable possibly causes a response in another is called the Granger Causality Test. But be careful and do not get confused with the name. The test does not strictly mean that we have estimated the causal effect of one variable on another. It means that the signal of the first one is a useful predictor of the second. A variable \\(X\\) is said to Granger cause another variable \\(Y\\) if \\(Y\\) can be better predicted from the past of \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) together than the past of \\(Y\\) alone, other relevant information being used in the prediction (Pierce, 1977).

Thus, we conclude that \\(X\\) Granger causes \\(Y\\). | . Impulse Response Functions . After establishing that \\(X\\) predicts the future of \\(Y\\), it is often useful to show exactly how how a shock in \\(X\\) in the present will impact \\(Y\\) in the future. Impulse response functions are a great way to visualize the magnitude and duration of this impact on \\(Y\\). Vector Autoregression . In order to visualize the impulse response function, we first need to transform the \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) variables through Vector Autoregression (VAR) modeling. In brief, VAR models are a multivariate generalization of scalar autoregressive (AR) models (for more information, see the AR Models page). Through a multivariate auto regression, we can use the autoregressive elements of each variable to visualize the granger causality we tested for earlier. VAR modeling can be done through the vars package in R. # If necessary # install.packages(\"vars\") library(vars) # Select only the X and Y columns and save as time series data data_ts = ts(data[2:3]) # Remove first lagged observation to omit NA values data_ts = data_ts |&gt; na.omit() # Save the model as a vector autoregression (VAR) model = VAR(data_ts, type = \"const\") . Plotting the IRF . Now that we have created our VAR model, we can plot how a shock to \\(X\\) will impact \\(Y\\). To do this we will use the vars::irf() function and the base R plot() function. # Create the impulse response function model_IRF = irf(model) # Plot plot(model_IRF) . This plot shows the response in \\(Y\\) to a shock in \\(X\\). As we would expect from the granger tests we ran earlier, a shock to \\(X\\) has a statistically significant effect on \\(Y\\). A positive shock to \\(X\\) results in a positive shock of similar magnitude in \\(Y\\) in the following period. This plot shows the response in \\(X\\) of a shock to \\(Y\\). A shock in \\(Y\\) elicits a very small, not statistically significant effect in \\(X\\). This is a visual confirmation that \\(Y\\) does not Granger cause \\(X\\). References . Granger, C. W.

    "title": "Marginal Effects in Nonlinear Regression",
    "content": "In linear regression, the effect of a predictor can be interpreted directly in terms of the outcome variable. For example, in the model \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\varepsilon\\), a one-unit increase in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\beta\\)-unit change in \\(Y\\). However, in nonlinear regression, this is no longer the case. For example, if \\(Y\\) is binary and \\(E(Y=1) = F(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X)\\) is estimated using a logit regression as a generalized linear model, then a one-unit increase in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\beta\\)-unit change in the index function which then passes through the logit link function to produce a change in \\(E(Y=1)\\). Confusing! . Commonly, we would prefer to state our results in terms of changes in the actual dependent variable, which can be more intuitive. Marginal effects are one way of doing this. The marginal effect of \\(X\\) on \\(Y\\) in that logit regression is the relationship between a one-unit change in \\(X\\) and the probability that \\(Y=1\\). Marginal effects can be calculated for all sorts of nonlinear models. This page will discuss only logit and probit, but the same concepts (and, often, code, especially for other generalized linear models) work for other nonlinear models. The marginal effect can be calculated by taking the derivative of the outcome variable with respect to the predictor of interest. This is how effects can be interpreted in general. Even in a linear model like \\(Y = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1X + \\varepsilon\\), we can see that \\(\\partial{Y}/\\partial{X} = \\beta_1\\), i.e. a one-unit change in \\(X\\) is associated with a \\(\\beta_1\\)-unit change in \\(Y\\). For both probit and logit models in the form \\(E(Y=1) = F(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X)\\), where \\(F()\\) is the link function, the marginal effect can be calculated as . \\[\\frac{\\partial{E(Y=1)}}{\\partial X} = \\beta_1F(\\cdot)(1-F(\\cdot))\\] Where \\(F(\\cdot) = F(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1X)\\) is the predicted probability that \\(Y=1\\) given the predictors in the model. This means that the marginal effect is different for each observation, since the predicted probability is different for each observation. Also, since \\(F(\\cdot)(1-F(\\cdot))\\) is highest near \\(F(\\cdot) = .5\\), this means that the marginal effect will be highest for observations with predicted probabilities near .5, and lowest for observations with predicted probabilities near 0 or 1. This makes sense - if you’re already predicted to have \\(Y = 1\\) with .99 probability, there’s not much more room for your probability to increase anyway - the marginal effect must be small! . The fact that the marginal effect is different for each individual also means that in order to present a single marginal effect, you must make a decision about how to combine everyone’s effect. There are several common approaches: . | The Marginal Effect of a Representative selects a single representative set of predictors (and thus a single representative predicted probability) and calculates the marginal effect for that representative. | The Marginal Effect at the Mean is the Marginal Effect of a Representative again, but this time the “representative” has the mean values of all of the predictors in the model. | The Average Marginal Effect calculates the marginal effect for each individual separately, and then takes the mean of the marginal effects. | . The average marginal effect is generally considered preferred (unless there is a particular representative of interest), since it accounts for correlations between the predictors, and creates an easily interpretable marginal effect. For more detail see The Effect, which this page draws from thoroughly. ",

    "content": "The simplest way to perform KNN in R is with the package class. It has a KNN function that is rather user friendly and does not require you to do distance computing as it runs everything with Euclidean distance. For more advanced types of nearest neighbors matching it would be best to use the matchit function from the matchit package. To verify results this example also used the confusionMatrix function from the package caret. Due to how this package is designed the most room for error is during normalization, by normalizing variables that do not require or cannot accept it, like character variables. Another good source of error is not including drop = TRUE for your target, or y, vector which will prevent the model from running. Finally, given the way this example verifies results it is vital to convert the target into a factor as the data has to be in similar kind in order for R to give you an output.

They can also be thought of as state machines. String functions can take a character variable and a regular expression, and show you whether and how they match. Regex is useful for extracting information from text such as documents, spreadsheets, log files, and code. Regex utilizes metacharacters that have specific meaning: $ * + . ? [ ] ^ { } | ( ) \\ to find what we are looking for within the string. They can be used for string matching / replacing, and are supported across several programming languages such as Python, R, Stata, SQL, and more, although syntax does sometimes differ slightly between languages. The metacharacters can be broken up into a few different groups based on their meaning. | Specify the amount of repetitions of the pattern . | *: matches at least 0 times. | +: matches at least 1 times. | ?: matches at most 1 times. | {n}: matches exactly n times. | {n,}: matches at least n times. | {n,m}: matches between n and m times. | . | Specify where the match will be located in the string or word . | ^: matches the start of the string. | $: matches the end of the string. | \\b: matches the empty string at either edge of a word. Don’t confuse it with ^ $ which marks the edge of a string. | \\B: matches the empty string provided it is not at an edge of a word. | . | Operators . | .: matches any single character. | [...]: a character list, matches any one of the characters inside the square brackets. | [^...]: an inverted character list.

    "content": "In Python, regular expressions are implemented in the re module or, alternatively, through the .str interface in pandas. Let’s go through a few examples: . If we want to search for all words that started with the characters “ab” we would use the character ^ to specify we want words that start with “ab”. import re strings = [\"abcd\", \"cdab\", \"cabd\", \"c abd\"] filtered_strings = [s for s in strings if re.search(r\"^ab\", s)] print(filtered_strings) # ['abcd'] . Some notes about this example: . | We’ve used the re.search function. Sometimes people instead use re.match. re.match only looks for matches at the beginning of strings, so the functions re.search(r\"^ab\", s) and re.match(r\"ab\", s) are equivalent. | You’ll notice that instead of using plain double quotes around our regular expression we used the pattern r\"^ab\". The r means “raw string”, and it turns off (almost) all escaping. Thus, r\"\\d\" and \"\\\\d\" are equivalent. Because of the how common \\ is in regular expressions, it’s usually wise to use raw strings for regular expressions to avoid confusing errors. | . Alternatively, we could use also implement the above example with pandas: . import pandas as pd df = pd.DataFrame({\"strings\": [\"abcd\", \"cdab\", \"cabd\", \"c abd\"]}) df[df[\"strings\"].str.contains(r\"^ab\", regex=True)] . If we instead want to replace the text that matches a regular expression, we can use the re.sub or pandas .str.replace: . import re import pandas as pd strings = [\"what\", \"why\", \"you\", \"blazers\", \"fire\", \"hello\"] # Replace all the vowels in strings containing a vowel with \"!\" changed_strings = [ re.sub(r\"[aeiou]\", \"!\", s) for s in strings if re.search(r\"[aeiou]\", s) ] print(changed_strings) # ['wh!t', 'y!!', 'bl!z!rs', 'f!r!', 'h!ll!'] # Do the same thing in pandas df = pd.DataFrame({\"strings\": strings}) changed_series = df.loc[ df[\"strings\"].str.contains(r\"[aeiou]\", regex=True), \"strings\" ].str.replace(r\"[aeiou]\", \"!\", regex=True) print(changed_series) # 0 wh!t # 2 y!! # 3 bl!z!rs # 4 f!r! # 5 h!ll! # Name: strings, dtype: object .

    "content": "In R, we can write our Regular expressions using the base R functions or with the stringr package functions. RegExplain is an RStudio addin for regular expressions. Regular expressions can be tricky at times, and RegExplain can help make it easier. RegExplain will allow you to build your regular expressions interactively. First, we can write a regular expression using the base R functions. Additional resources on Regex, string functions, and syntax. We can use the grep() function to identify filenames, for example. If we set the argument value = TRUE, grep() returns the matches, while value = FALSE returns their indices. grepl() is a similar function but returns a logical vector. Including ignore.case = TRUE ignores case sensitivity. Some special characters in R cannot be directly coded in a string (i.e '), so we have to “escape” the single quote in the pattern, by preceding it with \\. One important note about working with regular expressions in R is that, because \\ itself needs to be escaped, we must escape this metacharacter with a double backslash like \\\\$. For example, if we want to search for all words that started with the characters “ab” we would use the character ^ to specify we want words that start with “ab”. #create a string (string &lt;- c(\"abcd\", \"cdab\", \"cabd\", \"c abd\")) # regex to search for strings that start with ab grep(\"^ab\", string, value = TRUE) . grepl() will tell us if there is a match to the pattern. Functions like sub() and gsub() replace the matches with new text. There are plenty of subexpressions so I will show a few. string &lt;- c(\"what\", \"why\", \"you\", \"blazers\", \"fire\", \"hello\") # create string # here we get TRUE/FALSE depending on if the text has any of the vowels \"[aeiou]\" grepl(\"[aeiou]\", string) #we can use sub() and gsub() to replace text sub(\"[aeiou]\", \"!\", string) . Second, We can write the regular expression using the stringr package, which is said to be easier to use and remember. We can write a regular expression and use the stringr::str_match() function to extract all the phone numbers from the string. There are a number of other useful string functions in the stringr package. Additional resources on Regex, string functions, and syntax can be found here. Similar to using the base R function, we still want to use ^ to specify we want a work that starts with “ab”. Now we have to specify that we want the entire word, not just the “ab” portion by including the .* syntax, which means “look for any character (.) any number of times (*)”, in other words it picks up anything. # load package library(stringr) # create a string (string &lt;- c(\"abcd\", \"cdab\", \"cabd\", \"c abd\")) # regex to search for strings that start with ab str_match(string, \"^ab.*\") # Similar to the grepl function there is str_detect, and similar to the gsub function there is str_replace str_detect(string, \"[aeiou]\") # tells us T/F if the word contains any of the vowels in the given range. str_replace(x, \"[aeiou]\", \"!\") # we can replace any vowels in the specified range with a ```!``` in their respective words .

    "content": "This example will make use of the statsmodels package, and some of the description of rolling regression has benefitted from the documentation of that package. Rolling ordinary least squares applies OLS (ordinary least squares) across a fixed window of observations and then rolls (moves or slides) that window across the data set. The key parameter is window, which determines the number of observations used in each OLS regression. First, let’s import the packages we’ll be using. If you don’t already have these installed, open up your terminal (aka command line) and use the command pip install packagename where ‘packagename’ is the package you want to install. from statsmodels.regression.rolling import RollingOLS import statsmodels.api as sm from sklearn.datasets import make_regression import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd . Next we’ll create some random numbers to do our regression on . X, y = make_regression(n_samples=200, n_features=2, random_state=0, noise=4.0, bias=0) df = pd.DataFrame(X).rename(columns={0: 'feature0', 1: 'feature1'}) df['target'] = y df.head() . | | feature0 | feature1 | target | . | 0 | -0.955945 | -0.345982 | -36.740556 | . | 1 | -1.225436 | 0.844363 | 7.190031 | . | 2 | -0.692050 | 1.536377 | 44.389018 | . | 3 | 0.010500 | 1.785870 | 57.019515 | . | 4 | -0.895467 | 0.386902 | -16.088554 | . Now let’s fit the model using a formula and a window of 25 steps. roll_reg = RollingOLS.from_formula('target ~ feature0 + feature1 -1', window=25, data=df) model = roll_reg.fit() . Note that -1 just suppresses the intercept. We can see the parameters using model.params. Here are the params for time steps 20 to 30: . model.params[20:30] . | | feature0 | feature1 | . | 20 | NaN | NaN | . | 21 | NaN | NaN | . | 22 | NaN | NaN | . | 23 | NaN | NaN | . | 24 | 20.736214 | 35.287604 | . | 25 | 20.351719 | 35.173493 | . | 26 | 20.368027 | 35.095621 | . | 27 | 20.532655 | 34.919468 | . | 28 | 20.470171 | 35.365235 | . | 29 | 20.002261 | 35.666997 | . Note that there aren’t parameters for entries between 0 and 23 because our window is 25 steps wide. We can easily look at how any of the coefficients are changing over time. Here’s an example for ‘feature0’. fig = model.plot_recursive_coefficient(variables=['feature0']) plt.xlabel('Time step') plt.ylabel('Coefficient value') plt.show() . Recursive ordinary least squares (aka expanding window rolling regression) . A rolling regression with an expanding (rather than moving) window is effectively a recursive least squares model. We can perform this kind of estimation using the RecursiveLS function from statsmodels. Let’s fit this to the whole dataset: . reg_rls = sm.RecursiveLS.from_formula( 'target ~ feature0 + feature1 -1', df) model_rls = reg_rls.fit() print(model_rls.summary()) .

    "content": "In R, one of the best tools for creating scatterplots is the function ggplot(), found in the ggplot2 package. For this demonstration, we will also be using a dataset already built in to R called mtcars. To begin we will need to make sure we install and load ggplot2 as well as any other packages that are useful. #install and load necessary packages library(ggplot2) #load the dataset data(mtcars) . Next, we will use ggplot(), aes(), and geom_point() in order to create a basic scatterplot. For this plot, we will put car weight on the x-axis and miles-per-gallon on the y-axis. #assign the mtcars dataset to the plot and set each axis ggplot(data = mtcars,aes(x=wt,y=mpg)) + #create points on the plot for each observation geom_point() . It is important to remember to include the + after each line when creating a plot using ggplot(). This + tells R that the lines of code belong together and omitting it will lead to our plot not having important parts. Labelling is also an important task. In order to give our scatterplot axis labels and title, we will use the labs() function, in conjunction with our previous code. Don’t forget your +’s! . #assign our dataset and variables of interest to the plot ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg)) + #create the points geom_point() + #create axis labels and a title labs(x = \"Weight\", y = \"Miles Per Gallon\", title = \"Car MPG by Weight\") . That is starting to look better, but our graph could still use a little variety to it. Next, we will learn how to change the size and color of our plot points. | To change the size of the points in our scatterplot, we need to use the option size. The default size of points in ggplot is 1.5. We’re going to make the points 4, just in case someone is having trouble seeing them. | To change the color of our points, we will use color. In this example we will make our points blue. | . #assign our dataset and variables of interest ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x =wt, y = mpg)) + #create points and tell ggplot we want them to be size 4 and blue geom_point(size = 4, color = \"blue\") + #don't forget the labels labs(x = \"Weight\", y = \"Miles Per Gallon\", title = \"Car MPG by Weight\") . Finally, lets label our points. We can do this by adding a new element to our plot, geom_text(). For this example we will label the points on our plot with their horse power. This will allow us to see how horsepower is related to weight and miles-per-gallon. We are also going to set the size of our points to 0.5 to avoid cluttering the scatterplot too much. Just like we can change the color of our points, we can change the color of the labels we put on them. We’ll make them red in this example, but feel free to choose another color. #assign our dataset and variables of interest ggplot(data = mtcars, aes(x =wt, y = mpg)) + #create points and tell ggplot we want them to be size 0.5 and blue geom_point(size = 0.5, color = 'blue') + #add the labels for our points geom_text(label = mtcars$hp, color = 'red') #don't forget the labels labs(x = \"Weight\", y = \"Miles Per Gallon\", title = \"Car MPG by Weight\") .

    "content": "For this R demonstration, we will introduce how to use ggplot2 package to create nice scatterplots. First, we load all the libraries we will need. library(ggplot2) library(viridis) library(dplyr) library(RColorBrewer) library(tidyverse) library(ggthemes) library(ggpubr) . Step 1: Basic Scatterplot . Let’s start with the basic scatterplot. Say we want to check the relationship between Sepal width and Sepal length of the iris species. There are a few steps to construct the scatterplot: . | Step1: specify the dataset that we want to visualize | Step2: tell which variable to show on x and y axis | Step3: add a geom_point() in order to show the points | . If you have questions about how to use ggplot and aes, check Here for more help. ggplot(data = iris, aes( ## Put Sepal.Length on the x-axis, Sepal.Width on the y-axis x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width))+ ## Make it a scatterplot with geom_point() geom_point() . Step 2: Map a variable to marker feature . One of the most powerful and magic abilities of the ggplot2 package is to map a variable to marker features. Notice that attributes set outside of aes() apply to all points (like size=4 here), while attributes set inside of aes() set the attribute separately for the values of the variable. Transparency . We can distinguish the Species by alpha (transparency). ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, ## Where transparency comes in alpha=Species)) + geom_point(size =4, color=\"seagreen\") . Shape . shape is also a common way to help us to see relationship between two variables within different groups. Additionally, you can always change the shape of the points. Check here for more ideas. ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, ## Where shape comes in shape=Species)) + geom_point(size = 4,color=\"orange\") . Size . size is a great option that we can take a look at as well. However, note that size will work better with continuous variables. ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, ## Where size comes in size=Species)) + geom_point(shape = 18, color = \"#FC4E07\") . Color . Last but not least, let’s color these points depends on the variable Species in the iris dataset. ## First, we need to make sure that 'Species' is a factor variable ## class(iris$Species) ## Since 'Species' is already a factor variable, we do not need to do conversion ## However, in case 'Species' is not a factor variable, we can solve this question using as.factor() function, like below ## iris$Species &lt;- as.factor(iris$Species) ## Then, we are ready to plot ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, ## distinguish the species by color color=Species))+ geom_point() . | Note . | If you do not like the default colors in the ggplot2, there are a couple of ways to change that.The RColorBrewerpackage will definitely help. If you want to know more about RColorBrewer package,see here. Additionally,the viridis package is also very helpful to change the default colors. For more information of the viridis package, check here. | If you do not like all the options that the RColorBrewer and viridis packages provide, see here to work with color in the ggplot2 package. | . | . ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))+ geom_point()+ ## Where RColorBrewer package comes in scale_colour_brewer(palette = \"Set1\") ## There are more options available for palette ggplot(data = iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, color=Species))+ geom_point()+ ## Where viridis package comes in scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = \"D\") ## There are more options to choose . This first graph is using RColorBrewer package,and the second graph is using viridis package. Put all the options together . Of course, we can always mix color,transparency,shape and size together to get prettier plot. Simply set more than one of them in aes()! . Step 3: Find the comfortable themes . The next step that we can do is to figure out what the most fittable themes to match all the hard work we have done above. Themes from **ggplot2 package** . In fact, ggplot2 package has many cool themes available alreay such as theme_classic(), theme_minimal() and theme_bw(). Another famous theme is the dark theme: theme_dark(). Let’s check out some of them. ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, col=Species, shape=Species)) + geom_point(size=3) + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = \"D\") + theme_minimal(base_size = 12) . Themes from the ggthemes package . ggthemes package is also worth to check out for working any plots (maps,time-series data, and any other plots) that you are working on. theme_gdocs(), theme_tufte(), and theme_calc() all work very well. See here to get more cool themes. ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, col=Species, shape=Species)) + geom_point(size=3) + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = \"D\") + ## Using the theme_tufte() theme_tufte() . Create by your own . If you do not like themes that ggplot2 and ggthemes packages have, don’t worry. You can always create your own style for your themes. Check here to desgin your own unique style. Step 4: Play with labels . It is time to label all the useful information to make the plot be clear to your audiences. Basic Labelling . Both labs() and ggtitle() are great tools to deal with labelling information. In the following code, we provide the example how to use labs() to label the all the things that we need. Take a look here if you want to learn how to use ggtitle(). ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, col=Species, shape=Species)) + geom_point(size=3) + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = \"D\") + theme_minimal(base_size = 12)+ ## Where the labelling comes in labs( ## Tell people what x and y variables are x=\"Sepal Length\", y=\"Sepal Width\", ## Title of the plot title = \"Sepal length vs. Sepal width\", subtitle = \" plot within different Iris Species\" ) . Postion and Appearance . After the basic labelling, we want to make them nicer by playing around the postion and appearance (text size, color and faces). ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, col=Species, shape=Species)) + geom_point(size=3) + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = \"D\") + labs( x=\"Sepal Length\", y=\"Sepal Width\", title = \"Sepal length vs. Sepal width\", subtitle = \"plot within different Iris Species\" )+ theme_minimal(base_size = 12) + ## Change the title and subtitle position to the center theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ ## Change the appearance of the title and subtitle theme (plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey40\",size = 10, face = 'italic') ) . Step 5: Show some patterns . After done with step 4, you should end with a very neat and unquie plot. Let’s end up with this tutorial by checking whether there are some specific patterns in our dataset. Linear Trend . According to the plot, it seems like there exists a linear relationship between sepal length and sepal width. Thus, let’s add a linear trend to our scattplot to help readers see the pattern more directly using geom_smooth(). Note that the method argument in geom_smooth() allows to apply different smoothing method like glm, loess and more. See the doc for more. ggplot(iris, aes(x=Sepal.Length, y=Sepal.Width, col=Species, shape=Species)) + geom_point(size=3) + scale_color_viridis(discrete=TRUE,option = \"D\") + labs( x=\"Sepal Length\", y=\"Sepal Width\", title = \"Sepal length vs. Sepal width\", subtitle = \"plot within different Iris Species\" )+ theme_minimal(base_size = 12) + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5), plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5))+ theme (plot.title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 14, face = \"bold\"), plot.subtitle = element_text(color = \"grey40\",size = 10, face = 'italic')) + ## Where linear trend + confidence interval come in geom_smooth(method = 'lm',se=TRUE) . Congratulations!!! You just make your own style of scatterplots if you are following all the steps above and try to play around the different options. ",

    "title": "Stata",
    "content": "For this Stata demonstration, I will use a combination of scatter and twoway, both native commands in Stata, to create all the figures trying to emulate the structure you see above in R. While I want to use only official commands within Stata, I will use Ben Jann’s grstyle to set some basic graph themes, although I’ll keep them minimalistic. see help grstyle for more options. Setup . To replicate all figures here, you will need to make sure you have grstyle installed in your computer. To make things comparable to the R example, I will also use the Iris dataset. Other than that, I use the following setup: . ssc install grstyle grstyle init grstyle color background white grstyle set legend , nobox webuse iris, clear . Basic Scatterplot . Let’s start with the basic scatterplot. Say we want to check the relationship between Sepal width and Sepal length of the iris species. Basic scatterplots can be obtained using the command scatter. The general syntax is as follows: . scatter yvar1 [yvar2 yvar3 ...] xvar, [options] . You can choose to use one or more variables that will be measured in the vertical axis yvar. The last variable xvar will be used for the horizontal axis. For the example, I will plot only two variables: Sepal width and Sepal length. scatter sepwid seplen . Scatterplot by groups . Something you may want to do when producing Scatterplots is to visually separate different groups within the same scatterplot. For example, in the Iris data, we would like to see how sepal dimensions change by Iris type. To be able to do this, you need to use twoway to overlap multiple graphs together. There are two ways to create multiple overalping plots. The easier one is this: . twoway scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1 || /// scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2 || /// scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3 . | Where each subplot (by iris type) is separated using * |   | . The tripple forward slash */// is used to break the line, and avoid code that is too long to follow. | . The second option, my preferred option, is to separate each subplot, using parenthesis to encapsulate each subplot: . twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3) . This is convenient because allows you to add and differentiate options that affect a subplot, vs options that affect the whole twoway plot. One more thing. The basic plot (as above) differentiates each plot by color, but uses generic labels for each subgroup. So lets add labels for the three types of Irises. twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . Transparency . Starting in Stata 15, it is possible to add transparency to a figure. See that this is done using the option `color()’. For fun, Im using the same color on each subgroup: “forest_green”. twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(forest_green%10)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(forest_green%40)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(forest_green%80)), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . Shape/symbols . In Stata, you will use the word symbol rather than shape to differentiate the markers in a scatter plot. Symbols can be modified using the option symbol(). To see all options for symbols, you can type palette symbol. twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(gold) symbol(O)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(gold) symbol(T)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(gold) symbol(S)), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . Size . Size of a marker can be modified using the option size(). See help markersizestyle for all available size options. twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(red) msize(small)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(red) msize(medium)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(red) msize(large)), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . Color . This is the first option I applied earlier. However, this is a good opportunity to point out all the color options Stata has. See help colorstyle##colorstyle for options. In the example below I use the RBG approach to choose colors. twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(\"240 120 140\") ) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(\"100 190 150\") ) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(\"125 190 230\") ), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . Labels, Titles and Subtitles . I mentioned this earlier. Stata uses a variable label for the plot axis titles. However, you can modify that using the options xtitle() and ytitle(). It is also possible to add a title and subtitle to the figure, using options title() and subtitle() . twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(\"72 27 109\") symbol(O)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(\"33 144 140\") symbol(T)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(\"253 231 37\") symbol(s)), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\") col(3)) /// title(Sepal length vs Sepal width) subtitle(plot within different Iris Species) . Showing some patterns . Something else you may want to do is add bivarite fitted lines to emphasize particular relationships within pairs of variables. You can do this by adding additional subplots that will produce this information. In the example below, I add linear fitted values for all cases. I make sure to use the same line color, so they are consistent with the scatter plot. twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(\"72 27 109\") symbol(O)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(\"33 144 140\") symbol(T)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(\"253 231 37\") symbol(s)) /// (lfitci sepwid seplen if iris==1, clcolor(\"72 27 109\") clwidth(0.5) acolor(%50) ) /// (lfitci sepwid seplen if iris==2, clcolor(\"33 144 140\") clwidth(0.5) acolor(%50) ) /// (lfitci sepwid seplen if iris==3, clcolor(\"253 231 37\") clwidth(0.5) acolor(%50) ), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\") col(3)) /// title(Sepal length vs Sepal width) subtitle(plot within different Iris Species) /// xtitle(Sepal length in cm) ytitle(Sepal width in cm) . Of course, you can be more sophisticated, and use a local polynomial to identify those relationships: . twoway (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==1, color(\"72 27 109\") symbol(O)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==2, color(\"33 144 140\") symbol(T)) /// (scatter sepwid seplen if iris==3, color(\"253 231 37\") symbol(s)) /// (lpolyci sepwid seplen if iris==1, clcolor(\"72 27 109\") clwidth(0.5) acolor(%50) ) /// (lpolyci sepwid seplen if iris==2, clcolor(\"33 144 140\") clwidth(0.5) acolor(%50) ) /// (lpolyci sepwid seplen if iris==3, clcolor(\"253 231 37\") clwidth(0.5) acolor(%50) ), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\") col(3)) /// title(Sepal length vs Sepal width) subtitle(plot within different Iris Species) /// xtitle(Sepal length in cm) ytitle(Sepal width in cm) . And done. You can use the above guide to modify your plots as needed. ",

For more flexible tables that can be easily exported, we will be using the highly flexible estout package. For more information on the many different options and specifications for estout summary tables, see this page.

    "content": "A vector autoregression (VAR) of order \\(p\\), often abbreviated as VAR(\\(p\\)), is the following data-generating process (DGP): . \\[y_t = \\upsilon + A_1 y_{t-1} + \\ldots + A_p y_{t-p} + u_t \\, ,\\] for \\(t = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots\\), where \\(y_t = (y_{1t}, \\ldots, y_{Kt})'\\) is a (\\(K \\times 1\\)) random vector of observed data, the \\(A_i\\) are fixed (\\(K \\times K\\)) coefficient matrices, \\(\\upsilon = (\\upsilon_1 , \\ldots , \\upsilon_K)'\\) is a fixed (\\(K \\times 1\\)) vector of intercept terms, and \\(u_t = (u_{1t} , \\ldots , u_{Kt})'\\) is a \\(K\\)-dimensional innovation process with \\(E(u_t) = 0\\), \\(E(u_t u_t') = \\Sigma_u\\), and \\(E(u_t u_s') = 0\\) for \\(s \\neq t\\). Simply put, a VAR(\\(p\\)) is a model of the DGP underlying some random data vector \\(y_t\\) for all \\(t\\) as a function of \\(1, \\ldots , p\\) of its own lags, along with identically and independently distributed (iid) innovations. Any given VAR(\\(p\\)) process has an equivalent VAR(1) representation: . \\[Y_t = \\boldsymbol{\\upsilon} + \\boldsymbol{A} Y_{t-1} + U_t \\, ,\\] where . \\[Y_t = \\begin{bmatrix} y_t \\\\ y_{t-1} \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{t-p+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\, ,\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{\\upsilon} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\upsilon \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\, ,\\] \\[A = \\begin{bmatrix} A_1 &amp; A_2 &amp; \\ldots &amp; A_{p-1} &amp; A_p \\\\ I_K &amp; 0 &amp; \\ldots &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; I_K &amp; &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ \\vdots &amp; &amp; \\ddots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\vdots \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \\ldots &amp; I_K &amp; 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\, ,\\] and . \\[U_t = \\begin{bmatrix} u_t \\\\ 0 \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\, .\\] By the above ubiquitous formulation, any given VAR(\\(p\\)) is stable if \\(\\text{det}(I_{Kp} - \\boldsymbol{A}z) \\neq 0\\) for \\(|z| \\leq 1\\). In other words, if all eigenvalues of \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) live within the complex unit circle, we may express the VAR(1) model as . \\[Y_t = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\boldsymbol{A}^i U_{t-i} \\, ,\\] where \\(\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = E(Y_t) = (I_{Kp} - \\boldsymbol{A})^{-1} \\boldsymbol{\\upsilon}\\), \\(\\Gamma_Y(h) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty \\boldsymbol{A}^{h+i} \\Sigma_U (\\boldsymbol{A}^i)'\\), and \\(\\frac{\\partial Y_t}{U_{t-i}} = \\boldsymbol{A}^i \\rightarrow 0\\) as \\(i \\rightarrow \\infty\\). Intuitively, this means that the impulse response of \\(Y_t\\) to innovations converges to zero over time. Furthermore, a stable VAR(\\(p\\)) process is stationary – its first and second moments are time invariant. VAR(\\(p\\)) models may be estimated using a variety of statistical methods, with one of the most popular approaches being multivariate least squares estimation. Suppose we observe a sample time series \\(y_1, \\ldots, y_T\\), along with \\(p\\) presample values for each variable (effectively a combined sample size of \\(T+p\\)). Define . \\[Y = (y_1, \\ldots, y_T) \\, ,\\] \\[B = (\\upsilon, A_1, \\ldots, A_p) \\, ,\\] \\[Z_t = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ y_t \\\\ \\vdots \\\\ y_{t-p+1} \\end{bmatrix} \\, ,\\] \\[Z = (Z_0 , \\ldots, Z_{T-1}) \\, ,\\] \\[U = (u_1, \\ldots, u_T) \\, ,\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{y} = \\text{vec}(Y) \\,\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{\\beta} = \\text{vec}(B) \\,\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{b} = \\text{vec}(B') \\, ,\\] \\[\\boldsymbol{u} = \\text{vec}(U) \\, .\\] Using the above notvation, we may express any given VAR(\\(p\\)) model as . \\[Y = BZ + U \\, ,\\] or equivalently as . \\[\\text{vec}(Y) = \\text{vec}(B Z) + \\text{vec}(U) = (Z' \\otimes I_K) \\text{vec}(B) + \\text{vec}(U) \\, ,\\] or . \\[\\boldsymbol{y} = (Z' \\otimes I_K) \\boldsymbol{\\beta} + \\boldsymbol{u} \\, ,\\] with the covariance matrix of \\(\\boldsymbol{u}\\) being \\(\\Sigma_{\\boldsymbol{u}} = I_t \\otimes \\Sigma_u\\). It can be shown that the least-squares (LS) estimator for the given model is . \\[\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{b}} = \\text{vec}(\\widehat{B}') = (I_K \\otimes (Z Z')^{-1} Z) \\text{vec}(Y') \\, ,\\] which is equivalent to separately estimating each of the \\(K\\) equations in the standard formulation of a VAR(\\(p\\)) model using OLS. It can also be shown that if \\(y_t\\) is stable with standard white noise disturbances, we can ues the \\(t\\)-ratios provided by common regression programs in setting up confidence intervals and tests for individual coefficients. These \\(t\\)-statistics can be obtained by dividing the elements of \\(\\widehat{B}\\) by square roots of the corresponding diagonal elements of \\((Z Z')^{-1} \\otimes \\widehat{\\Sigma}_u\\). ",

    "content": "Julia community puts a lot of effort into development of Neural Networks ecosystem. These efforts are largely fueled and greatly helped by two major features of Julia. First, pure Julia code (with a little help from the developer) gets translated into efficient and optimized machine code in many cases rivaling C/C++. This largely alleviates “two languages problem”. Second, Julia features advanced metaprogramming facilities making possible sophisticated source code transformations, Automatic Differentiation in particular. The main production-quality Machine Learning framework is Flux and Lux presents an alternative better suited for and motivated by Scientific Machine Learning tasks. In the following example we’ll stick with the former. using Flux, MLUtils n_samples = 1000 n_features = 10 hidden_layer_size = 100 # our underlying equation will be # y = x1 + 10*x2 - 7*x3 + 2*x4 + 3*x5 - 14*x6 + x7 + 3*x8 - x9 + 11*x10 - 40 # the coefficients are arbitrary, they don't represent anything # we'll collect them in a single (column) vector coeffs = [1, 10, -7, 2, 3, -14, 1, 3, -1, 11] b = -40 # a n_samples*n_features matrix of \"observations\" X = randn(Float32, n_samples, n_features) # calculating \"responses\" corresponding to \"observations\" X # according to the above equation (using matrix-vector product) # adding a little random noise y = X*coeffs .+ b .+ 0.02f0 .* randn(Float32, n_samples) # We leave out 15 % of the data for testing train_data, test_data = splitobs((X', y); at=0.85) # our model consists of two fully connected layers, first one using `relu` activation model = Chain(Dense(n_features =&gt; hidden_layer_size, relu), Dense(hidden_layer_size =&gt; 1)) # we're collecting all of the model's parameters (weights and biases of all the layers) parameters = Flux.params(model) # using Mean Sqared Error as a measure of the loss # we can use our Neural Network as if it was just a function, applying it # to a single observation or the whole set of observations at once loss(x, y) = Flux.Losses.mse(model(x), y) # currently our model is an extremely poor fit to both train and test data loss(train_data[1], train_data[2]') # 2123.2031f0 loss(test_data[1], test_data[2]') # 1939.8761f0 # we'll use ADAM optimization strategy with default parameters opt = Adam() # now let's train our model wrt. our data!

Another prominent feature of the Julia ecosystem, especially with relation to Neural Networks, is highly-developed support for NVidia GPUs (AMD and Intel GPUs support is under development as well). CUDA.jl library provides Julia bindings and high-level functions as well as underlying CUDA and CuNN C++ libraries, thus simple import Pkg; Pkg.add(\"CUDA\") makes you ready to offload your computations to a graphics card. For the most part Flux is oblivious to the location of data — RAM or GPU — therefore after copying all our data to a GPU we can feed it to exactly the same functions for training, loss and so on. For copying we’ll employ Flux.gpu function which does nothing if there’s no CUDA installed. This way our code can be GPU-oblivious too: it will use GPU if one is present, otherwise it will work just as fine on a CPU (albeit slower). import CUDA # we don't actually need to directly call functions from the CUDA library # but we want to be sure it got loaded. # also we can call `CUDA.functional()` to check if a GPU is present and accessible. # copying the data to a GPU with the `Flux.gpu` function gpu_train_data = (gpu(collect(train_data[1])), gpu(collect(train_data[2]))) gpu_test_data = (gpu(collect(test_data[1])), gpu(collect(test_data[2]))) # building a new untrained model and moving it to a GPU gpu_model = gpu(Chain(Dense(n_features =&gt; hidden_layer_size, relu), Dense(hidden_layer_size =&gt; 1))) gpu_ps = Flux.params(gpu_model) # the same loss function but now using `gpu_model` gpu_loss(x, y) = Flux.Losses.mse(gpu_model(x), y) # the loss of an untrained model is again very high # but now all the calculations happen on a GPU gpu_loss(gpu_train_data[1], gpu_train_data[2]') # 2134.6206f0 gpu_loss(gpu_test_data[1], gpu_test_data[2]') # 2145.352f0 # here we use `Flux.DataLoader` to feed our training data into the `Flux.train!` function # 50 (batchsize) instances at a time.

    "content": "There are many plotting libraries in Python, including declarative (say what you want) and imperative (build what you want) options. In the example below, we’ll explore several different options for plotting bar chart data. For even greater control over plot elements, users may want to explore the matplotlib library (and its bar chart functionality here), but the examples below will cover most use cases. By far the quickest way to plot a bar chart is to use data analysis package pandas’ built-in bar chart option. import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(\"https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/DAAG/Manitoba.lakes.csv\", index_col=0) df.plot.bar(y='area', legend=False, title='Area of lakes in Manitoba'); . This produces a functional, if not hugely attractive, plot. Calling the function without the y='area' keyword argument causes pandas to plot two columns for each lake based on the two variables in the dataframe, one for area and one for elevation (while sharing the same y-axis). pandas uses the plotting library matplotlib under the hood. Many extra configuration options are available using matplotlib. In this case, let’s just tidy the plot up a bit by applying a style, adding in a label, and putting the title on the left. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.style.use('seaborn') ax = df.plot.bar(y='area', legend=False, ylabel='Area', rot=15) ax.set_title('Area of lakes in Manitoba', loc='left'); . For more sophisticated visualisations, let’s look first at the seaborn library. We’ll use the tips dataset. Note that if seaborn finds more than one row per category for the bar chart, it will automatically create error bars based on the standard deviation of your data. Although it is declarative, seaborn is built on matplotlib (like pandas built-in plots), so finer control of plots is available should it be needed. (Like df.plot.bar, sns.barplot returns an ax object when not used with the ; character.) . import seaborn as sns tips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\") sns.barplot(x=\"day\", y=\"total_bill\", hue=\"sex\", data=tips); . Yet another declarative option comes from plotnine, which is a port of R’s ggplot and so has nearly identical syntax that library. from plotnine import ggplot, geom_bar, aes, labs ( ggplot(tips) + geom_bar(aes(x='day'), colour='black', fill='blue') + labs(x = \"Day\", y = \"Number\", title = \"Number of diners\") ) . Other packages for bar charts include proplot, an imperative library for publication-quality charts that wraps matplotlib, and altair, a declarative library which produces high-quality, web-ready graphics.

By adding additional functions to our graph! . ggplot(data = starwars) + geom_bar( mapping = aes(x = species), color = \"black\", fill = \"blue\") + labs(x = \"Species\", y = \"Total\", title = \"Character Appearences in Movies by Species\") + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) . This graph looks much more interpretable to me, though appearences are subjective. Let’s look at what we did. First there are two additional parts to our mapping function, color and fill. The “color = ” provides an outline color to the bars on the graph, while “fill = ” provides the color within the bars. The x and y axis have been renamed, and the graph has been given a title. This was done using the labs() function in R. This function has additional options as well which you should explore. Finally we come to the theme() function in ggplot2. theme() has many options to customize any type of graph in R. For this basic tutorial, the x values (species) have been rotated so that they are legible compared to our first graph. Congratualtions, you have made your first bar graph in R! . There is a similar ggplot() function in R called geom_col. In geom_col, you can specify what you want the y axis to be, whereas geom_bar is only a count. Want more information on how to customize your graph? The Hadley Wickam book called R for Data Science is a fantastic place to start, and best of all it’s free! . ",

You could also set bin width so that every bin is of equal width (and has unequal amount of observations falling into each bin). | Once observations are placed into bins using the conditioning variable, an outcome variable (usually the y variable) is produced by aggregating all observations in the bin and using a summary statistic to obtain one single point.

If you produce many bootstrap samples and calculate a statistic in each of them, then under certain conditions, the distribution of that statistic across the bootstrap samples is the sampling distribution of that statistic.

Cluster-robust standard errors for many different kinds of regression objects in R can be obtained using the vcovCL or vcovBS functions from the sandwich package (link). To perform statistical inference, we combine these with the coeftest function from the lmtest package. This approach allows users to adjust the standard errors for a model “on-the-fly” (i.e. post-estimation) and is thus very flexible. # Read in data from the College Scorecard df &lt;- read.csv( \"https://github.com/LOST-STATS/lost-stats.github.io/raw/source/Model_Estimation/Data/Fixed_Effects_in_Linear_Regression/Scorecard.csv\" ) # Create a regression model with normal (iid) errors my_model &lt;- lm(repay_rate ~ earnings_med + state_abbr, data = df) # Swap out cluster-robust errors post-estimation with coeftest::lmtest and sandwich::vcovCL library(lmtest) library(sandwich) coeftest(my_model, vcov = vcovCL(my_model, cluster = ~inst_name)) . Alternately, users can specify clustered standard errors directly in the model call using the lm_robust function from the estimatr package (link). This latter approach is very similar to how errors are clustered in Stata, for example. # Alternately, use estimator::lm_robust to specify clustered SEs in the original model call. # Standard error types are referred to as CR0, CR1 (\"stata\"), CR2 here. # Here, CR2 is the default library(estimatr) my_model2 &lt;- lm_robust( repay_rate ~ earnings_med + state_abbr, data = df, clusters = inst_name, se_type = \"stata\" ) summary(my_model2) .

    "content": "There are a huge array of color palette options and user-defined themes available in R. In the examples that follow, we’ll limit ourselves to demonstrating with ggplot2 (link), although the same principles apply to base R plots, and only one or two additional palette themes. First, let’s load in some data that we can use to demonstrate color palette options. For these examples, we will use the palmer penguins data from the palmerpenguins package. # load in palmerpenguins package library(palmerpenguins) # Load the penguins data into memory data(\"penguins\") . Discrete Data . The first two examples will deal with discrete color palettes for modeling discrete data. Let’s first demonstrate a color palette option that comes with the ggplot2 package, which will be used throughout this post to construct graphs. Let’s see what ggplot2 offers in terms of color customization by graphing penguin bill length and bill depth coloring by species. # load ggplot2 library(ggplot2) # graph bill length vs depth coloring by species ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, color=species)) + geom_point() . ggplot2 provides default color options for quick graph making. However, we can change the colors for the species by using the scale_color_brewer() function from the ggplot2 package . # recreate previous graph, now using the scale_color_brewer() to change color palette last_plot() + scale_color_brewer(palette = \"RdYlGn\") . By using the scale_color_brewer() function (which again comes bundled with ggplot2), we are able to change the color palette used to color the data points. This is particularly helpful when we need to color many different groups, as we can specify a palette with lots of colors available to assign to each group. There are many different palette options we can specify, check out the ggplot2 website for more available options. In addition to changing the color of data points, we can use color palettes to change the fill color of a graph object, which is particularly useful when creating bar charts, line graphs, boxPlots, or filling in confidence intervals. Let’s create a new example where we make a bar chart of the number of penguins from each species in the data set: . # create bar chart of number of penguins from each species, coloring the fill of the bars by species ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x=species)) + geom_bar(aes(fill = species)) . Again, ggplot2 uses default colors to fill in the bars. However, we can change these colors using a dedicated color palette package. Let’s try the ggsci package (link) this time, which comes with many different fill options inspired by those used in science journals and popular tv shows. For the example below, we’ll use the scale_fill_simpsons() function to change the bar colors to a set inspired by the long-running comedy show. # load in ggsci package library(ggsci) # add the scale_fill_simpsons() function to change bar colors last_plot() + scale_fill_simpsons() . Now the bars are a different set of colors from the default set! If you want to learn more about all the options available from the ggsci package, visit its cran page. Continuous Data . The previous examples use a discrete variable to color the data by. We can also apply color palettes to continuous variables for a color gradient scale. Let’s return to the first example, but change the variable we are coloring by from “species” to body_mass_g and see what we get. # Recreate first example, but switch color to body_mass_g variable ggplot(data = penguins, aes(x=bill_length_mm, y=bill_depth_mm, color=body_mass_g)) + geom_point() . Now, instead of having a set number of colors modeling our data, we see a gradient scale in the legend on the left-hand side of the chart. ggplot2 defaults to a blue color gradient, with lighter shades of blue representing heavier penguins. It is a bit difficult to discern the different shades, however, making this graph hard to read. A popular alterative these days is the viridis palette, which ggplot2 includes as an option.. # recall previous plot, but this time using scale_color_viridis_c() # note that the \"_c\" suffix indicates \"continuous\" data last_plot() + scale_color_viridis_c() . Now we have a better idea about how penguin body mass relates to bill length and depth. The scale_color_viridis_C() function is well known for having a wide range of color shades as well as being visible to color blind people. These simple examples are certainly not the end-all be-all, but they should hopefully demonstrate that there are lots of customization options available for your graphs. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what type of data you are modeling. Make sure to keep in mind too how you should call attention to specific parts of your charts to best convey the information within the data. With that being said, the options are seemingly endless when it comes to color palettes in R, so play around with your favorite color palette packages to find the best option for you! .

    "title": "Stata",
    "content": "Stata has more limited native options to use colors and color palettes to graphs. However, thanks to Ben Jann package colrspace and palettes, it is relatively easy to extract and translate color palettes to be used in Stata. In addition, it is also possible to combine this packages with grstyle (also by Ben Jann), to modify the colors of the scheme in memory, to easily change the colors of most of your graphs. To facilitate further the use of colors in your graphs, I put together a wrapper that will combine the use of Ben Jann’s packages, to easily combine palettes and schemes, for most of your color needs. Setup . First, we need to install a few packages from ssc. * To modify schemes ssc install grstyle * To add color palettes and palettes translators in Stata net install palettes , replace from(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjann/palettes/master/\") net install colrspace, replace from(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benjann/colrspace/master/\") * A wrapper for the commands above, plus adding other predefined palettes ssc install color_style . Second, lets load some data that we can use to demonstrate color palette options. For these examples, I will use iris.dta dataset. This has similar characteristics as the penguins dataset used in the R example above. The examples that follow will try to replicate the figures described in R. I will also use the scheme white, which is clear than the Stata default scheme. webuse iris, clear . Discrete Data . The first two examples will deal color palettes for discrete data, emphasizing on the use of color_style. We start by creating a simple scatter of sepal length and with by iris type, using default color options in Stata. Note that there is a new comand (mscatter in ssc) that can create scatterplots by groups more directly. However, I will stay with the simpler scatter for this example. two (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==1) /// (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==2) /// (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==3), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . This, however, generates dots with colors that are hard to differentiate. We could, instead use “tableau” colors: . color_style tableau two (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==1) /// (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==2) /// (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==3), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . Alternatively, we could use a more colorful palette option, such as RdYlGn. However, because this palette is made for continous data, you would do better if instead use color_style option n(#). color_style RdYlGn, n(3) two (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==1) /// (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==2) /// (scatter seplen sepwid if iris==3), /// legend(order(1 \"Sectosa\" 2 \"Versicolor\" 3 \"Virginica\")) . By using color_style function, we can change the colors used for the data points. However, using this method has the hard constrain of defining up to 15 different colors. Check the helpfile of colorpalette to see all predefined colorpalette options, and type color_style, list for additional palettes that come with this command. In addition to changing the color of data points, we can use color palettes to change the fill color of a graph object, which is particularly useful when creating bar charts, line graphs, boxPlots, or filling in confidence intervals. Let’s create a new example where we plot the means of sepal and petal length and width. color_style s2 graph bar (mean) seplen sepwid petlen petwid, title(\"S2color-Stata Default\") name(m1) color_style RdYlGn graph bar (mean) seplen sepwid petlen petwid, title(\"RdYlGn-up to 15\") name(m2) color_style RdYlGn, n(4) graph bar (mean) seplen sepwid petlen petwid, title(\"RdYlGn-for 4 groups\") name(m3) color_style google graph bar (mean) seplen sepwid petlen petwid, title(\"Google-Palette\") name(m4) graph combine m1 m2 m3 m4, nocopies . There could be, however, that a particular palette is not yet available in color_style, or colorpalette. If you have the HEX colors, you can still use them!. Here I use “Simpsons” and “Tron” hex colors for the bar graphs. ** Like Simpsons (ggsci) color_style #FED439 #709AE1 #8A9197 #D2AF81 graph bar (mean) seplen sepwid petlen petwid, title(\"S2color-Stata Default\") name(m5) ** Like Tron (ggsci) color_style #FF410D #6EE2FF #F7C530 #95CC5E graph bar (mean) seplen sepwid petlen petwid, title(\"RdYlGn-up to 15\") name(m6) graph combine m5 m6, nocopies . Continuous Data . The previous examples use a discrete variable to color the data by. While colorpalette allows you to set colors for continuous data as well, using interpolation of colors when appropriate, schemes can only manage up to 15 different groups. There are other user written commands, however that work with colorpalette on the background, and may allow you to do this kind of graphs . ** Like Scatter but for multiple groups. ssc install mscatter mscatter seplen sepwid, over(petlen) colorpalette(viridis) alegend msize(2) title(viridis) name(m7, replace) legend(col(2)) mscatter seplen sepwid, over(petlen) colorpalette(egypt) alegend msize(2) title(egypt) name(m8, replace) legend(col(2)) mscatter seplen sepwid, over(petlen) colorpalette(magma) alegend msize(2) title(magma) name(m9, replace) legend(col(2)) mscatter seplen sepwid, over(petlen) colorpalette(google) alegend msize(2) title(google) name(m10, replace) legend(col(2)) graph combine m7 m8 m9 m10, nocopies altshrink . While this approach provides an option for multiple levels of colors, some work is needed to have better formatted labels. These simple examples should demonstrate that there are lots of customization options available for your graphs. Ultimately, it comes down to personal preference and what type of data you are modeling. Make sure to keep in mind too how you should call attention to specific parts of your charts to best convey the information within the data. What is happening in the background . To understand what is happening in the background. color_style calls on colorpalette to identify colors for a particular palette. colorpalette comes loaded with many predefined palettes, which are constantly being updated. Once the colors are obtained, color_style calls on grstyle to modify all color attributes in the current scheme. color_style also comes with a good selection of palettes, that one may want to explore. By default, color_style uses all colors in a particular palette, recycling them if more colors are needed. However, one can request use fewer colors (say 3), for better color contrast. This may depend on the type of palette one is using. Using this method only allows you to change colors for up to 15 groups. Other programs exist, however, when one wants to use more than 15 groups of colors. ",

To analyze the relationship between the education and financial measures, we need them in the same dataset and so would want to combine them. If both datasets had a unique identification field for each person, such as a social security number or other national id, we could use this to match the records, so that all information from the same person appeared on the same line.

    "content": "A Quick Prelude About “Master” And “Using” Datasets . When merging two datasets together, there are two relevant datasets to consider. The first is the one currently in Stata’s memory, the other is whatever dataset (not currently loaded into Stata) that you would like to merge onto the dataset in memory. For ease of reference, Stata calls the dataset in memory the “master” dataset and the other file the “using” dataset. When you see the syntax of the merge command, the reason for calling it the “using” dataset will become clear. In Stata, there are 3 types of deterministic merges: . 1-to-1 . A one-to-one merge expects there to be no more than one row in each dataset to have a matched pair in the other dataset. If there is more than one observation with the same identifying variable(s) in either the master or using datasets when attempting to do a one-to-one merge, Stata will throw an error. (Note: you can check to see if there is more than one observation per identifying variable by using the “duplicates report” command, or the Gtools variant for especially large datasets, called “gduplicates report.”) . *Import Data with Car Sizes and Merge it to Data on Car Prices using the ID variable “Make” webuse autosize.dta, clear merge 1:1 make using http://www.stata-press.com/data/r14/autoexpense.dta . Note that the syntax specifies “make” as the identifying variable after the merge type (1:1) and before the using statement (thus why we call the data not in memory the “using” data. The result of this merge shows 5 successful matches and one observation from the master dataset that did not have a match. | Result | # of obs. | _merge value | . | not matched from master | 1 | (_merge==1) | . | not matched from using | 0 | (_merge==2) | . |   |   |   | . | matched | 5 | (_merge==3) | . Note that Stata creates a new variable (_merge) during the merge that stores the merge status of each observation, where a value of 1 means that the observation was only found in the master dataset, 2 means it was found only in the using dataset, and 3 means it was found in both and successfully merged. Many-to-1 . A many-to-one merge occurs when the master dataset contains multiple observations of the same unit or individual (say, multiple test scores for the same student), while the using dataset has only one observation per unit or individual (say, the age of each student). Here is the syntax for a many-to-1 merge. *Import Data with Car Sizes and Merge it to Data on Car Prices using the ID variable “Make” webuse sforce.dta, clear merge m:1 region using http://www.stata-press.com/data/r14/dollars.dta . Note that in this case that the syntax changes from merge 1:1 to merge m:1 where m stands for many. In this case, the identifying variable is “region.” . 1-to-Many . A one-to-many merge is the opposite of a many to one merge, with multiple observations for the same unit or individual in the using rather than the master data. The only different in the syntax is that it becomes merge 1:m rather than merge m:1. Many-to-Many . A many-to-many merge is intended for use when there are multiple observations for each combination of the set of merging variables in both master and using data. However, merge m:m has strange behavior that is effectively never what you want, and it is not recommended. ",

    "content": "The above solves the problem for you locally, but not for the broader community! In this section, we’ll describe generic instructions for creating an Anaconda feedstock for a Python 3 package. There are detailed instructions here, but we found them a bit confusing for relatively simple packages. First, an overview of the steps: . | Fork the conda-forge/staged-recipes repo on GitHub. | Create the skeleton recipe for your package. | Edit the skeleton recipe. | Create a PR for your recipe. | Work with conda-forge maintainers until your recipe is merged. | . Forking the conda-forge/staged-recipes repo . On GitHub, go to conda-forge/staged-recipes and fork the repository. If you already have a fork, I recommend deleting your fork and reforking. This repository is highly volatile. Creating the skeleton recipe . As above, we’ll assume you’re working with the linearmodels package. We’ll also assume you’re working in REPO_DIR as defined below. You’ll need to run the below scripts. REPO_DIR=~/repo GITHUB_USER=khwilson PACKAGE=linearmodels LOCAL_REPO_DIR=\"${REPO_DIR}/staged-recipes\" # Make sure your REPO_DIR exists mkdir -p $REPO_DIR &amp;&amp; cd $REPO_DIR # Pull your fork git clone \"https://github.com/${GITHUB_USER}/staged-recipes.git\" cd $LOCAL_REPO_DIR # Create the skeleton recipe cd \"recipes\" conda skeleton pypi $PACKAGE . You should now see a file in “${PACKAGE}/meta.yaml”. This is your skeleton recipe. Edit the recipe . You’ll need to make several changes to the skeleton. These can be divided into: . | Make the recipe py3k only. | If your recipe involves Cython, adding some build requirements. | Getting the license setup. | Other “about” metadata. | Add your name to the list of maintainers. | . Make the recipe py3k only . In the build section, add a key skip: True # [py2k] . If your recipe involves Cython . In the requirements section: . | Add a build section that looks like this: ```yaml | . build: . | {{ compiler(‘c’) }} | {{ compiler(‘cxx’) }} | . * In the `host` section, change the line involving `pip` to `pip &gt;=10`. * In the `run` section, remove any references to Cython and pip. #### Getting the license setup This is probably the most annoying part. Find your packages online home. Copy the LICENSE file to your recipe's directory. Then in the `about` section, add the line `license_file: NAME_OF_LICENSE_FILE`, where `NAME_OF_LICENSE_FILE` is the file you saved the license to. Also, you'll need to describe the license by type. Sometimes, conda can figure this out for you. However, sometimes you'll need to figure it out. To do so, you can typically dump large parts of the text into Google and it will tell you the name. In the worst case, you may need to physically search [this page](https://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical). Once you've found the license, add `license: SPDX_SHORT_CODE` to the `about` block. N.B. You may also need to add a `license_family` to the `about` block. However, the errors should tell you how to do this. :-) #### Other `about` metatdata There are some other stubs in the `about` section that conda should have setup for you, specifically around docs. If you can find these online, then add them here. #### Add your name to the list of maintainers Finally, at the bottom of the `meta.yaml` file, you will need a section that looks like: ```yaml extra: recipe-maintainers: - khwilson . Here you should obviously replace khwilson with your own GitHub username. This completes the main part of recipe editing. Create a PR for your recipe . Before creating a PR for your recipe, you probably want to test your recipe locally. To do so, you’ll need to have docker installed. Then run the following: . cd $LOCAL_REPO_DIR # Remove extra recipes rm -rf recipes/example recipes/spyrmsd . Then in the .circleci/build_steps.sh file, comment out the line that starts git ls-tree --name-only master -- .. Then you should be able to run ./.circleci/run_docker_build.sh. You’ll probably see some errors which you’ll need to fix. Once these errors are sorted out, you can push your recipe to GitHub and create a PR. Make sure to name the PR something memorable, e.g., Adding linearmodels recipe. ",

This means you don’t have to create a different dummy vector for every value. If you are interested in looking behind the scenes you can use model.matrix() to see how R is creating dummies from these factor class variables. Note: model.matrix() creates a separate dummy column for all values in the vector. This is called one-hot encoding and, if you aren’t careful, can lead to the dummy variable trap if an intercept is also included in the regression. The dummy variable trap arises because of perfect multicollinearity between the intercept term and the dummy variables (which row-wise all add up to 1). So one of the columns needs to be dropped from the regression in order for it to run. Typically, the first variable is the one which is dropped and effectively absorbed into the intercept term. If this happens then all the dummy estimates will be in reference to the dropped dummy. ",

    "title": "Encode the categorical data into dummy variables",
    "content": "encoded_colors = MLBase.OneHotEncoder()(colors) . In this example, we start by importing the MLBase package, which provides the OneHotEncoder function for creating dummy variables. Next, we define an array colors that represents the categorical variable we want to encode. In this case, it contains different colors. To create the dummy variables, we use the OneHotEncoder() function and apply it to the colors array. The function automatically encodes the categorical data into a matrix of dummy variables. After executing this code, the encoded_colors variable will contain a matrix where each row represents an observation, and each column represents a category from the original colors array. The values in the matrix are either 0 or 1, indicating whether a particular category is present for each observation. For example, if we print the encoded_colors matrix, it might look like this: . 3×3 Matrix{Float64}: 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 1.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 1.0 . In this case, the first column represents the category \"red\", the second column represents \"green\", and the third column represents \"blue\". The value of 1 in each row indicates the presence of that category for that particular observation, while the value of 0 indicates the absence of that category. This encoding allows you to use the resulting matrix of dummy variables in machine learning models or other data analysis tasks where numerical data is required. ## R Turning a categorical variable into a set of dummies ```r data(iris) # To retain the column of dummies for the first # categorical value we remove the intercept model.matrix(~-1+Species, data=iris) # Then we can add the dummies to the original data iris &lt;- cbind(iris, model.matrix(~-1+Species, data=iris)) # Of course, in a regression we can skip this process summary(lm(Sepal.Length ~ Petal.Length + Species, data = iris)) . If you are only creating one dummy at a time rather than a set from a factor variable, creating a dummy variable doesn’t have to be any different than creating any other variable. Below are several ways to create a new variable in R. dplyr::mutate . Let’s say that we want our dummy to indicate if variable_1 &gt; variable_2. To do this we can use mutate: . # If necessary, install dplyr # install.packages('dplyr') library(dplyr) data(iris) # The below takes existing data (iris) and adds # a new variable (Long.Petal) based on existing variables # (Petal.Length and Petal.Width) and saves the result as # mutated_data. # Note: new variables do not have to be based on old # variables mutated_data = iris %&gt;% mutate(Long.Petal = Petal.Length &gt; Petal.Width) . This will create a new column of logical (TRUE/FALSE) variables. This works just fine for most uses of dummy variables. However if you need the variables to be 1s and 0s you can now take . mutated_data &lt;- mutated_data %&gt;% mutate(Long.Petal = Long.Petal*1) . You could also nest that operation inside the original creation of new_dummy like so: . mutated_data = iris %&gt;% mutate(Long.Petal = (Petal.Length &gt; Petal.Width)*1) . Base R . #the following creates a 5 x 2 data frame letters = c(\"a\",\"b\",\"c\", \"d\", \"e\") numbers = c(1,2,3,4,5) df = data.frame(letters,numbers) . Now I’ll show several different ways to create a dummy indicating if the numbers variable is odd. df$dummy = df$numbers%%2 df$dummy = ifelse(df$numbers%%2==1,1,0) df$dummy = df$numbers%%2==1 # the last one created a logical outcome to convert to numerical we can either df$dummy = df$dummy * 1 # or df$dummy = (df$numbers%%2==1) *1 .

In MATLAB you can store variables as columns in arrays. If you know you are going to add columns multiple times to the same array it is best practice to pre-allocate the final size of the array for computational efficiency.

    "content": "Decision trees are among the most common and useful machine learning methodologies. While they are a relatively simple method, they are incredibly easy to understand and implement for both classification and regression problems. A decision tree “grows” by creating a cutoff point (often called a split) at a single point in the data that maximizes accuracy. The tree’s prediction is then based on the mean of the region that results from the input data. For both regression and classification trees, it is important to optimize the number of splits that we allow the tree to make. If there is no limit, the trees would be able to create as many splits as the data will allow. This would mean the tree could perfectly “predict” every value from the training dataset, but would perform terribly out of sample (i.e., overfit the data). As such, it is important to keep a reasonable limit on the number of splits. This is achieved by creating a penalty that the algorithm has to pay in order to perform another split. If the increase in accuracy is worth more than the penalty, it will make the split. For regression trees, the decision to split along a continuum of values is often made by minimizing the residual sum of squares: . \\[minimize \\sum(y-prediction)^2\\] This should be highly reminiscent of ordinary least squares. Where this differs is in the number of splits created, the binary nature of the splits, and its nonlinear nature. The methodology behind classificiation is very similar, except the splits are decided by minimizing purity, such as the Gini index: . \\[G= 1 - \\sum_{i = 1}^{C} (p_{i})^2\\] The goal here is to create regions with as of classifications as possible, as such, a smaller Gini index implies a more pure region.

    "content": "The Regression Discontinuity Design can be applied in cases where a running variable (a.k.a. forcing variable) determines treatment, at least partially, and where the treatment assignment changes significantly at a cutoff variable. In sharp designs, there is no treatment if the running variable is to one side of the cutoff, but everyone with a running variable to the other side of the cutoff is treated. Regression discontinuity in all its forms (sharp, fuzzy, kink, etc.) relies on an assumption that the running variable is not being manipulated around the cutoff value. For example, imagine the running variable is a math test score, the treatment is getting to skip a grade in math, and treatment assignment is that you get to skip a grade if your score is above 90 (cutoff). If someone knows they’re about to get an 89 and so works extra hard because they know how close they are to the cutoff, or if a grader observes someone getting an 89, decides they’re close enough, and fudges their score to be a 90 so they can skip a grade, then the running variable is being manipulated. You can no longer assume that people just on either side of the cutoff are comparable, and the research design falls apart. Density discontinuity tests are intended to check for the presence of manipulation at the cutoff. Generally, they examine the density distribution of the running variable, and look for a discontinuity in the density function just to either side of the cutoff. If there is one (in our math score example, perhaps we see hardly anyone with an 88 or 89, but lots of people with 90 or 91), then the running variable is probably manipulated. There are several ways to perform this test, all of them descending from McCrary (2008). This page will also show the test based on Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2020), which requires fewer choices of tuning parameters, and takes fuller advantage of local polynomial regression. ",

This is basic, but there are lots of ways to adjust it through keyword arguments (you can see these by running help(sns.kdeplot)) or via calling functions on the matplotlib ax object that running sns.kdeplot returns when not followed by ;. In this simple example, the cut keyword argument forces the density estimate to end at the end-points of the data–which makes sense for a variable like price, which has a hard cut-off at 0. Let’s use further keyword arguments to enrich the plot, including different colours (‘hues’) for each cut of diamond. One keyword argument that may not be obvious is hue_order. The default function call would have arranged the cut types so that the ‘Fair’ cut obscured the other types, so the argument passed to the hue_order keyword below reverses the order of the unique list of diamond cuts via [::-1]. sns.kdeplot(data=diamonds, x=\"price\", hue=\"cut\", hue_order=diamonds['cut'].unique()[::-1], fill=True, alpha=.4, linewidth=0.5, cut=0.); .

Next, in order to make a density plot, we are going to use the ggplot() and geom_density() functions. We will specify price as our x-axis. ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_density() . We can always change the color of the density plot using the col argument and fill the color inside the density plot using fill argument. Furthermore, we can specify the degree of transparency density fill area using the argument alpha where alpha ranges from 0 to 1. ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price))+ geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\", col = 'black', alpha = 0.6) . We can also change the type of line of the density plot as well by adding linetype= inside geom_density(). ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_density(fill = \"lightblue\", col = 'black', linetype = \"dashed\") . Furthermore, you can also combine both histogram and density plots together. ggplot(diamonds, aes(x = price)) + geom_histogram(aes(y = ..density..), colour = \"black\", fill = \"grey45\") + geom_density(col = \"red\", size = 1,linetype = \"dashed\") . What happen if we want to make multiple densities? . For example, we want to make multiple densities plots for price based on the type of cut, all we need to do is adding fill=cut inside aes(). ggplot(data=diamonds, aes(x = price, fill = cut)) + geom_density(adjust = 1.5, alpha = .3) .

We can build a basic density plot using the kdensity subcommand of twoway: . * Plot the kernel density with plotplain theming twoway kdensity price, scheme(plotplainblind) . To overlay densities for multiple variables or multiple groups, it is possible to use the standard twoway graph stacking syntax: . * Plot the density of two separate columns twoway (kdensity depth) (kdensity table), scheme(plotplainblind) * Plot the same variable separately by group, overlaid on a single set of axes twoway (kdensity price if cut == \"Fair\", lcolor(blue)) (kdensity price if cut == \"Good\", lcolor(red)), scheme(plotplainblind) legend(lab(1 \"Cut: Fair\") lab(2 \"Cut: Good\")) . However, the syntax for doing separate densities by group can get onerous very quickly with more than a handful of groups, noting that you’ll have to specify each group with an if by hand, be careful about the color/presentation of each line, and do the legend yourself. Much easier for by-group kernel densities is the mkdensity package, which still uses kdensity under the hood, but just handles some of this busywork for you. On the other hand it doesn’t accept a scheme() option. But you can still use it via set scheme. The downside of this approach, rather than doing it by hand, is that it relies on . set scheme plotplainblind * if necessary, install with ssc install mkdensity mkdensity price, over(cut) . ",

It constructs a set of matching weights that, by design, forces certain balance metrics to hold. This means that, like with Coarsened Exact Matching there is no need to iterate on a matching model by performing the match, checking the balance, and trying different parameters to improve balance. However, unlike coarsened exact matching, entropy balancing does not require enormous data sets or drop large portions of the sample. Entropy balancing requires a set of balance conditions to be provided. These are often of the form “the mean of matching variable \\(A\\) must be the same between treated and control observations,” i.e. \\[\\sum_{i|D_i=0}w_iA_i = \\sum_{i|D_i=1}A_i\\] where \\(D_i\\) indicates treatment status and \\(w_i\\) are the matching weights, and similarly for other variables for which the mean should match. However, other conditions can also be included, such as matching to equalize the variance of a matching variable, or the skewness, and so on. This is sort of like the Generalized Method of Moments . Then, the entropy balancing algorithm searches for a set of matching weights \\(w_i\\) that best satisfies the set of balance conditions. These matching weights can then be used to weight an analysis comparing the treated and control groups to remove measured confounding between them. ",

    "content": "A Difference-in-Difference (DID) event study, or a Dynamic DID model, is a useful tool in evaluating treatment effects of the pre- and post- treatment periods in your respective study. However, since treatment can be staggered — where the treatment group are treated at different time periods — it might be challenging to create a clean event study. We will try to address these issues explicitly in the implementation examples that follow. Important: The dataset used for the implementation examples on this page derives from a staggered treatment (“rollout”) design. Various studies have shone a light on the potential biases that can result from applying a standard, twoway fixed-effect (TWFE) regression estimator on such a staggered setup, including Sun and Abraham (2020), Callaway and Sant’Anna (2020), and Goodman-Bacon (2021). Where possible, we will highlight these issues and provide code examples that addresses the potential baises. Note that in cases where the rollout is not staggered (i.e. there is only one treatment period), the same approaches can be applied without loss. The regression that DID event studies are based aroud is: . \\[Y_{gt} = \\alpha + \\Sigma_{k=T_0}^{-2}\\beta_k\\times treat_{gk}+\\Sigma_{k=0}^{T_1}\\beta_k\\times treat_{gk}+ X_{st}\\Gamma+\\phi_s+\\gamma_t+\\epsilon_{gt}\\] Where: . | \\(treat_{sk}\\) is a dummy variable, equaling 1 if the observation’s periods relative to the group \\(g\\)’s first treated period is the same value as k; 0 otherwise (and 0 for all never-treated groups). | \\(T_0\\) and \\(T_1\\) are the lowest and highest number of leads and lags to consider surrouning the treatment period, respectively. | \\(X`\\) are controls . | \\(\\phi\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are state and time fixed effects . | Estimation is generally performed with standard errors clustered at the group level . | . Important notes on the regression: . | The point of the regression is to show for each period before and after treatment that the coefficients on the pre-treated periods are statistically insignificant . | Showing the control and treated groups are statistically the same before treatment (\\(\\beta_k=0\\) for \\(k &lt; 0\\)) supports, though does not prove, the parallel trends assumption in DID estimation. | One of the time periods must be dropped to avoid perfect multicollinearity (as in most fixed-effects setups). In most event studies, the -1 time lag is used as the dropped reference. | . ",

    "content": "A variety of R packages can be used to conduct event-study DiD analysis. Here we will use fixest, which is both extremely fast and provides several convenience features (including ES graphics and implementation of the Sun-Abraham method). Note that we are using version 0.9.0 of fixest. library(data.table) ## For some minor data wrangling library(fixest) ## NB: Requires version &gt;=0.9.0 # Load and prepare data dat = fread(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LOST-STATS/LOST-STATS.github.io/master/Model_Estimation/Data/Event_Study_DiD/bacon_example.csv\") # Let's create a more user-friendly indicator of which states received treatment dat[, treat := ifelse(is.na(`_nfd`), 0, 1)] # Create a \"time_to_treatment\" variable for each state, so that treatment is # relative for all treated units. For the never-treated (i.e. control) units, # we'll arbitrarily set the \"time_to_treatment\" value at 0. This value # doesn't really matter, since it will be canceled by the treat==0 interaction # anyway. But we do want to make sure they aren't NA, otherwise feols would drop # these never-treated observations at estimation time and our results will be # off. dat[, time_to_treat := ifelse(treat==1, year - `_nfd`, 0)] . Let’s run our event study model. Again, we’ll be using fixest::feols() to do so. Note that the key time × treatment interaction takes place via the special i() operator. In the below case, we are essentially implementing a standard two-way fixed-effects (TWFE) procedure. We’ll also specify state+year fixed effects and explicitly cluster the standard errors at the state level (although this would be done by default). mod_twfe = feols(asmrs ~ i(time_to_treat, treat, ref = -1) + ## Our key interaction: time × treatment status pcinc + asmrh + cases | ## Other controls stfips + year, ## FEs cluster = ~stfips, ## Clustered SEs data = dat) . While it’s relatively straightforward to convert this model object into a data frame and then plot manually using ggplot2, this is more work than we need to do here. Specifically, fixest provides a convenient iplot() function for plotting the interaction term coefficients from a model. The resulting plot can be heavily customized, but for event-study designs it generally does exactly what you’d want out of the box. iplot(mod_twfe, xlab = 'Time to treatment', main = 'Event study: Staggered treatment (TWFE)') . This results in: . As earlier mentioned, the standard TWFE approach to event studies is subject to various problems in the presence of staggered treatment rollout. Fortunately, fixest provides the sunab() convenience function for estimating the aggregated “cohort” method proposed by Sun and Abraham (2020). In the below example, the only material change is to swap out the i() interaction with the sunab() equivalent. # Following Sun and Abraham, we give our never-treated units a fake \"treatment\" # date far outside the relevant study period. dat[, year_treated := ifelse(treat==0, 10000, `_nfd`)] # Now we re-run our model from earlier, but this time swapping out # `i(time_to_treat, treat, ref = -1)` for `sunab(year_treated, year)`. # See `?sunab`. mod_sa = feols(asmrs ~ sunab(year_treated, year) + ## The only thing that's changed pcinc + asmrh + cases | stfips + year, cluster = ~stfips, data = dat) . Again, we can use iplot() to depict the resulting event study in graphical form. In this case, we’ll plot both the new Sun-Abraham mode results and the previous (naive) TWFE model results . iplot(list(mod_twfe, mod_sa), sep = 0.5, ref.line = -1, xlab = 'Time to treatment', main = 'Event study: Staggered treatment') legend(\"bottomleft\", col = c(1, 2), pch = c(20, 17), legend = c(\"TWFE\", \"Sun &amp; Abraham (2020)\")) .

    "content": "Python has both imperative and declarative plotting libraries, and many of them have support for faceted graphs. In the example below, we’ll look at three libraries: two declarative, seaborn and plotnine, and one imperative, matplotlib. The imperative library matplotlib is by far the most popular plotting tool in Python, having been used as part of efforts to detect gravitational waves and produce the first image of a black hole. Often, other libraries build upon it as a foundation. For plots that will be shown on the web, the declarative library altair has very good facet support. Because matplotlib is imperative, it takes more effort by the user to produce a simple facet chart. So the first example below will use seaborn, a declarative library that builds on matplotlib. We’ll use it to produce a plot from the Penguins dataset, with a facet for each island. As ever, you may need to conda or pip install the libraries used in the examples. import seaborn as sns # Load the example Penguins dataset df = sns.load_dataset(\"penguins\") # Plot a scatter of bill properties with # columns (facets) given by island and colour # given by the species of Penguin sns.relplot(x=\"bill_depth_mm\", y=\"bill_length_mm\", hue=\"species\", col=\"island\", alpha=.5, palette=\"muted\", data=df) . Results in: . If you have used R for plotting, you might be familiar with the ggplot package. plotnine is another declarative plotting library in Python that is inspired by the API for ggplot in R. from plotnine import * from plotnine.data import mtcars (ggplot(mtcars, aes('wt', 'mpg', color='factor(gear)')) + geom_point() + stat_smooth(method='lm') + facet_wrap('~gear')) . Results in: . For more complex charts, where you want full control over facet placement, the imperative library matplotlib has a wealth of options. The code for a simple facet plot using synthetic data is: . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np # Some example data to display x = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 400) y = np.sin(x ** 2) fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, sharex=True) fig.suptitle('Two sine waves') ax1.plot(x, y) ax2.scatter(x + 1, -y, color='red') . (NB: no figure shown in this case.) Note how everything is specified. While plt.subplots(nrows, ncols, ...) allows for a rectangular facet grid, even more complex facets can be constructed using the mosaic option in matplotlib version 3.3.0+. The arrangment of facets can be specified either through text, as in the example below, or with lists of lists: . import matplotlib.pyplot as plt axd = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True).subplot_mosaic( \"\"\" TTE L.E \"\"\") for k, ax in axd.items(): ax.text(0.5, 0.5, k, ha='center', va='center', fontsize=36, color='darkgrey') .

This package has a data frame (it is like a table in R), called ‘mpg’ which contains observations collected by the US Environmental Protection Agency on 38 models of car.

We will limit our examples here to the two fastest implementations — lfe::felm and fixest::feols — both of which support high-dimensional fixed effects and standard error correction (multiway clustering, etc.). We first demonstrate fixed effects in R using felm from the lfe package (link). lfe::felm uses the Method of Alternating Projections to “sweep out” the fixed effects and avoid estimating them directly. By default, this is automatically done in parallel, using all available cores on a user’s machine to maximize performance. (It is also possible to change this behaviour.) . library(lfe) # Read in data from the College Scorecard df &lt;- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LOST-STATS/LOST-STATS.github.io/master/Model_Estimation/Data/Fixed_Effects_in_Linear_Regression/Scorecard.csv') # Calculate proportion of graduates working df$prop_working &lt;- df$count_working/(df$count_working + df$count_not_working) # A felm formula is constructed as: # outcome ~ # covariates | # fixed effects | # instrumental variables specification | # cluster variables for standard errors # Here let's regress earnings_med on prop_working # with institution name and year as our fixed effects # And clusters for institution name felm_model &lt;- felm(earnings_med ~ prop_working | inst_name + year | 0 | inst_name, data = df) # Look at our results summary(felm_model) . Next, we consider feols from the fixest package (link). The syntax is very similar to lfe::felm and again the estimation will be done in parallel by default. However, rather than the method of alternating projections, fixest::feols uses a concentrated maximum likelihood method to efficiently estimate models with an arbitrary number of fixed effects. Current benchmarks suggest that this can yield significant speed gains, especially for large problems. For the below example, we’ll continue with the same College Scorecard dataset already loaded into memory. # If necessary, install fixest # install.packages('fixest') library(fixest) # Run the same regression as before feols_model &lt;- feols(earnings_med ~ prop_working | inst_name + year, data = df) # Look at our results # Standard errors are automatically clustered at the inst_name level summary(feols_model) # It is also possible to specify additional or different clustering of errors summary(feols_model, se = \"twoway\") summary(feols_model, cluster = c(\"inst_name\", \"year\")) ## same as the above . As noted above, there are numerous other ways to implement fixed effect models in R. Users may also wish to look at the plm, lme4, and estimatr packages among others. For example, the latter’s estimatr::lm_robust function provides syntax that may be more familar syntax to new R users who are coming over from Stata.

    "content": "Let’s walk through an example in R to learn how to manipulate intervals on graph axes. The dataset used in this article example will be the diamonds dataset since it comes with the package ggplot2: you can follow along with this brief tutorial at home. This data reports prices of over 50,000 round cut diamonds. library(ggplot2) . Let’s begin with a graph plotting price and clarity of a diamond, and seeing what it gives us as a default axis. We plot histogram in ggplot2 by using the ggplot() function with the diamonds dataset, and adding geom_density() to plot a histogram. Aesthetic mappings describe how variables in the data are mapped to visual properties(aesthetics) of geoms. diamonds %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_histogram(binwidth=500, aes(x=price)) . Now let’s manipulate the four main elements of the axis: titles, scale, marks and ticks, value labels, and limits. Axis titles can be changed using the labs() command. This works not only for the x and y axes, but also any other aesthetic that has a legend. (You can also set the title, subtitle, and caption in labs() - those aren’t axes but a lot of people don’t know you can use labs() for this! Who needs ggtitle?). We’ll switch to geom_density() here so we can add, and then label, a color aesthetic. diamonds %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_density(aes(x=price, color = cut)) + labs(x = 'Price', y = 'Density', color = 'Diamond Cut') . The scale and limits of the axes can be set using one of the scale_ functions. scale_x_log10(), for example, will use a logarithmic scale for the x-axis. There are a lot of different scale_ functions for different combinations of axis (including axes like color and shape, not just x and y) and scale type. You can use the limits argument inside of a scale_ function to determine the limits of the axis. The limits can be outside the range of the data, “zooming out” on the graph, or inside the range of the data, cutting some of the data out of the graph. Note that using limits inside scale_ will remove all data outside the limits. If you want to retain that data but just zoom the window in, instead look at the xlim and ylim arguments of coord_cartesian(). Note you can also use the position argument of scale_x_ and scale_y_ functions to move the axes themselves, perhaps putting the x-axis line at the \"top\" for example. diamonds %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_density(aes(x=price, color = cut)) + labs(x = 'Price (Log Scale)', y = 'Density', color = 'Diamond Cut') + scale_x_log10(limits = c(1, 5000)) # I use 1 instead of 0 here because log(0) is undefined . Note how (1) the x-axis is now on a logarithmic scale, (2) the density numbers are different - density has been recalculated after dropping data outside the range, we haven’t just “zoomed in”, and (3) the graph begins and ends at our specified limits. The scale_ functions can also be used to label the values on the axes and specify how many tick marks there are. The breaks option lets you specify how many (or which) values get markers on the axis. The labels option lets you give it a function (or vector of values) that it uses to turn value labels in the data to printed labels on the graph. The scales package has a lot of good functions for use here in formatting numbers for print, like number(), dollar(), and percent(). These arguments canbe very useful in avoiding scientific notation, which ggplot2 tends to default to in a lot of cases. labels is also handy for labeling discrete values. In this example scale_color_discrete is being used to relabel the categories in the legend, but this would also work if the cut variable were on the x-axis with scale_x_discrete. diamonds %&gt;% ggplot() + geom_density(aes(x=price, color = cut)) + labs(x = 'Price (Log Scale)', y = 'Density', color = 'Diamond Cut') + scale_x_log10(limits = c(1, 5000), breaks = c(100, 1000, 3000), labels = scales::dollar) + scale_color_discrete(labels = c('Fair' = 'Worst', 'Good' = 'Okay', 'Very Good' = 'Nice', 'Premium' = 'Better', 'Ideal' = 'Oh Dang')) . Note that if you don’t like the scales function defaults, you can use an unnamed function. For example, labels = function(x) scales::dollar(x, accuracy = 1) (or labels = \\(x) scales::dollar(x, accuracy = 1) in R 4.1) would get rid of those cents after the decimal place. Finally, we can manipulate the look of the axes and ticks using the theme() function. The axis.ticks (or axis.ticks.x and axis.ticks.y to just change one of them) option takes an element_line() argument, in which you can set options like size, color, and so on. You can also change the axis.line (or axis.line.x and axis.line.y) options to change the look of the actual axis lines. There are also axis.text and axis.title options for changing how the text looks with element_text(). Now, let’s manipulate the size of the ticks on the x axis. Let’s make them really wide for effect, and also really long. Let’s choose “12 point unit” long length ticks for dramatic effect. diamonds %&gt;% ggplot()+ geom_histogram(binwidth=500, aes(x=price)) + theme(axis.ticks.x = element_line(size = 5), axis.ticks.length = unit(12, \"pt\")) .

More specifically, in aes() we color the point depending on the number of cylinders. fig1 &lt;- ggplot(mtcars, aes(wt, mpg, colour = factor(cyl))) + geom_point() fig1 . Now we can add another layor by giving each type of transition a different shape through shape in aes().

To change the legend position use the theme() modifier in ggplot. From there you can choose top, right, bottom, left, or none (removes the legend). To put the legends inside the plot create column vector of size 2 (the first value refers to the x coordinate. while the second refers to the y) where both elements are between 0 and 1. To ensure that the whole legends is within the graph use the legend.justification to set the corner where you want the legend. fig2 + theme( legend.justification = c(1, 1), legend.position = c(.95, .95) ) . You can also use this function with pre-set locations like \"bottom\", \"left\" \"right\" and \"top\" where ggplot centers the legend on the side you choose. fig2 + theme( legend.position = \"bottom\" ) . There are other cool things you can do to the legend to better customize the visual experience by adding more to the theme modifier such as: . | Changing the margin size with legend.box.margin | The color of the box around the legend with legend.box.background | Changing the font size and color with legend.text | Changing the boxes of the legend key with legend.key | . fig3 &lt;- fig2 + theme( legend.box.background = element_rect(color=\"red\", size=2), legend.box.margin = margin(116, 6, 6, 6), legend.key = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = \"black\"), legend.text = element_text(size = 8, colour = \"red\") ) fig3 . Sometimes you may want to remove a legend for the sake of graph readability or to reduce clutter. You can remove a legend by changing its position to “none” within the theme modifier. fig4 &lt;- fig2 + theme(legend.position = \"none\") fig4 . You can alternately remove legends (or components of legends) with guides . # Here we've removed the color legend, but the shape legend is still there. fig5 &lt;- fig2 + guides(color = FALSE) fig5 # This removes both fig6 &lt;- fig2 + guides(color = FALSE, shape = FALSE) fig6 .

    "content": "In Stata the legend is automatically added when you create a graph with multiple lines. However there may be instances where you would still prefer to have a legend on a single line graph or possibly no legend on your graph in general. For those times just add legend(on) or legend(off). * Let's use the US Life Expectancy data that comes with Stata sysuse uslifeexp.dta, clear line le year, legend(on) . Labelling legends is also straight forward, within the legend function add label(n \"line title\") to augment the titles, where ‘n’ is the nth group. line le_m le_f year, legend(label(1 \"Males\") label(2 \"Females\")) . Legend position can be changed with the position(), col(), and ring() modifiers in the legend() function. Here position refers to where the legend is placed with respect to the center of the graph using clock directions (i.e. 6 is 6 o’clock or below and 3 is 3 o’clock or right). col() is the number of columns the legend will take up, usually you just want to set the to be 1 to prevent the graph and legend fighting over space. ring() refers to the distance away from the center of the graph. line le_m le_f year, legend(pos(3) col(1) lab(1 \"Males\") lab(2 \"Females\") stack) . Then you can add some color to the legend with region() and a title with subtitle(): . line le_m le_f year, legend(pos(5) ring(0) col(1) lab(1 \"Males\") lab(2 \"Females\") region(fcolor(gs15))) legend(subtitle(\"Legend\")) . In the case where you are dealing with a two-way or a combination of graphs, augmenting the legend is exactly like above only now you must specify the line which you want to augment. Take this example from the stata manual on two-way graphs: . line le_wm year, yaxis(1 2) xaxis(1 2) /// || line le_bm year /// || line diff year /// || lfit diff year /// ||, /// ylabel(0(5)20, axis(2) gmin angle(horizontal)) /// ylabel(0 20(10)80, gmax angle(horizontal)) /// ytitle(\"\", axis(2)) /// xlabel(1918, axis(2)) xtitle(\"\", axis(2)) /// ylabel(, axis(2) grid) /// ytitle(\"Life expectancy at birth (years)\") /// title(\"White and black life expectancy\") /// subtitle(\"USA, 1900-1999\") /// note(\"Source: National Vital Statistics, Vol 50, No. 6\" /// \"(1918 dip caused by 1918 Influenza Pandemic)\") /// legend(label(1 \"White males\") label(2 \"Black males\")) /// legend(col(1) pos(3)) . Notice within the label() command nested within legend() you must specify which part of the graph you’re labeling first (the number denotes its order i.e. the first graph is 1) then the new label with a space between both items. Here they change the legend label for the first 2 lines. In regards to legend positioning, the same rules discussed above apply. Sources .

There are multiple ways to geocode. For instance, you could find the corrdinates of the Empire State building by flying to New York, riding an elevator to the top of the building, and then using your GPS to get the latitiude and longitude of where you were standing. A much more efficient way of geocoding is through interpolation. Interpolation uses other known geocoded locations to estimate the coordinates of the data that you wish to geocode. A computer uses an algorithm and the closest known geocodes to conduct this interpolation. However, the farther the “closest” known geocodes are to the data you are trying to geocode the less accurate the geocoding process is. smartystreets, a geocode platform, has a good explanation of this. Additionally, Reverse Geocoding takes a latitude-longitude pair (or other global coordinates) and converts it into an address or a place.

    "content": "rgeocodio allows you to access the Geocodio platform in R studio. Instead of the steps mentioned above you can use the rgeocodio to perform the same functions. In order to install rgeocodio you will need to load the devtools package. Install it if you haven’t already install.packages(\"devtools\"). Once devtools is loaded run:devtools::install_github('hrbrmstr/rgeocodio'). rgeocodio uses an API that you can get from the geocodio website. To get an API visit geocodio’s website. Then save it in your Renviron. To save the API in your Renvrion: . | Open the Renviron by running usethis::edit_r_environ() | Once you are in the Renviron name and save the API you got from Geocodio. Maybe something like: | . #geocodio_API = 'your api` . | Save your Renviron and then restart your R session just to be sure that the API is saved. | . Now that you have your API saved in R you still need to authorize the API in your R session. Do so by running gio_auth(). # If necessary # install.packages(c('rgeocodio','readxl','tidyverse')) library(rgeocodio) gio_auth(force = F) . A quick note, force makes you set a new geocodio API key for the current environment. In general you will want to run force=F. Lets try a regeocodio example. Say you want to get the coordinates of the White House. You could run: . rgeocodio::gio_geocode('1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington DC 20500') . Most of these variables are intuitive but I want to spend a few seconds on accuracy and accuracy type which we can learn more about here. | Accuracy: because geocodio is interpolating the output will tell you how confident geocodio is in its estimation. Anything below 0.8 should be considered not accurate enough, but that is up to the user. | Accuracy Type: interpolation uses the closest know geocodes. So if the closest geocodes are, for instance two ends of a street and you are trying to geocode a location somewhere on that street then the accuracy type will be “street.” In this case the accuracy type is “rooftop” which means the buildings on either side of the location were used to interpolate your query. Again, smartystreets has a good explanation of this. | . What if we want to geocode a bunch of addresses at once? To geocode multiple addresses at once we will use gio_batch_geocode. The data that we enter will need to be a character vector of addresses. library(readxl) library(tidyverse) addresses&lt;- c('Yosemite National Park, California', '1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington DC 20500', '2975 Kincaide St Eugene, Oregon, 97405') gio_batch_geocode(addresses) . You will notice that the output is a list with dataframes of the results embedded. There are a number of ways to extract the relevant data but one approach would be: . addresses&lt;- c('Yosemite National Park, California', '1600 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington DC 20500', '2975 Kincaide St Eugene, Oregon, 97405') extract_function&lt;- function(addresses){ data&lt;-gio_batch_geocode(addresses) vector&lt;- (1: length(addresses)) df_function&lt;-function(vector){ df&lt;-data$response_results[vector] df&lt;-df%&gt;%as.data.frame() } geocode_data&lt;-do.call(bind_rows, lapply(vector, df_function)) return(geocode_data) } extract_function(addresses) . Reverse geocoding uses gio_reverse and gio_batch_reverse. For gio_reverse you submit a longitude-latitude pair: . gio_reverse(38.89767, -77.03655) . For gio_batch_reverse we will submit a vector of numeric entries ordered by c(longitude, latitude): . #make a dataset data&lt;-data.frame( lat = c(35.9746000, 32.8793700, 33.8337100, 35.4171240), lon = c(-77.9658000, -96.6303900, -117.8362320, -80.6784760) ) gio_batch_reverse(data) . Notice that the output gives us multiple accuracy types. What about geocoding the rest of the world, chico? . rgeocodio::gio_batch_geocode('523-303, 350 Mokdongdong-ro, Yangcheon-Gu, Seoul, South Korea 07987') . gasp Geocodio only works, from my understanding, in the United States and Canada.

    "title": "Stata",
    "content": "Stata provides an official command gmm, which can be used for the estimation of models via this method if you provide moments of interest. The first example will be in recovering the coefficients that determine the distribution of a variable, assuming that variable follows a normal distribution. First lets simulate some data, and set the parameters . **# Normal distribution *** Parameters to estimate local mu = 3 local sigma = 2 *** Generate sample set seed 219 clear set obs 500 gen x = rnormal(`mu',`sigma') . In this code, I use local to identify the true parameters of interest. the mean mu and standard deviation sigma. Im also using set seed, to simulare data that can be replicated. The variable x is obtained based on a random draw from a normal distribution. The next step is to declare all the moment conditions. Here Im declaring them with local but could be written just as well with global or written directly instead of the ``m1’ expressions in the gmm` command. Keep in mind that locals only stay in memory locally. Once you run the program, they dissapear. Globals instead, can be used at any point after they are declared. For this reason, when using the code for this example, either copy it by hand into the console, or put it all in the same do file and run it together, so the locals are all in the same environment together. In the gmm syntax below, the coefficients of interest to be estimated, are written within curly brakets “{}”. I can also declare within the brakets initial values for the coefficients. Here mu=1 and sigma=1. Following the example above, we can declare 3 equations to define the moments for a normal distribution: the mean, the variance, and the kurtosis. However, because there are only 2 unknowns (mean and standard deviation), the model will be overidentified. This means that I can use either all 3 moments, or just any 2 of them. In this case, because the true distribution is normal, you only need two parameters to describe the distribution. Thus, you should get the same results, (or quite close), regardless of which pair of moments you use. *** Declare moments restrictions local m1 {mu=1}-x local m2 {sigma=1}^2 - (x-{mu=1})^2 local m3 x^3 - {mu=1}*({mu}^2+3*{sigma=1}^2) gmm (`m1') (`m2') (`m3'), winitial(identity) est sto m1 gmm (`m1') (`m2') , winitial(identity) est sto m2 gmm (`m1') (`m3') , winitial(identity) est sto m3 gmm (`m2') (`m3') , winitial(identity) est sto m4 est tab m1 m2 m3 m4, se . A second example for the use of gmm is for the estimation of standard linear regression models. For this, lets create some data, where the variable of interest is \\(X\\) . **# LR estimation *** Parameters to estimate local a0 1 local a1 2 clear set obs 500 *** Exogenous variables gen z1 = rnormal(1,2) gen z2 = rnormal(-1,1) *** unobserved error gen e = rnormal() *** Data Generating process gen x = z1+z2+e // X is endogenous to e gen y=`a0'+`a1'*x+e . Next, we can use gmm to estimate the model, under different assumptions . *** gmm ignoring endogeneity ** this is your error local m1 y-{a0}-{a1}*x ** which implies First order condition E(m1)=0 ** and E(x*m1)=0 gmm (`m1'), winitial(identity) instrument(x) *** gmm with endogeneity ** here, it implies E(z*m1)=0 local m1 y-{a0}-{a1}*x gmm (`m1'), winitial(identity) instrument(z1) est sto m1 gmm (`m1'), winitial(identity) instrument(z2) est sto m2 gmm (`m1'), winitial(identity) instrument(z1 z2) est sto m3 est tab m1 m2 m3, se ** I could also write the moment conditions more explicitly local m1 y-{a0}-{a1}*x gmm (`m1') (z1*(`m1')), winitial(identity) est sto m1 gmm (`m1') (z2*(`m1')), winitial(identity) est sto m2 gmm (`m1') (z1*(`m1')) (z2*(`m1')), winitial(identity) est sto m3 est tab m1 m2 m3, se ** producing the same results as before .

After viewing the data, we can create a scatterplot with the y-axis representing the total amount of hours the animal is asleep, the x axis representing the weight of the animal’s brain, and the dots of the scatterplot colored by the -vore type of the animal. #basic scatterplot of sleep against brain weight sleep_plot &lt;- ggplot(data=msleep, aes(x = sleep_total, y = brainwt, color = vore)) + geom_point() sleep_plot . Now that we have this basic plot, we can use the theme function to customize it. The ggplot2 package comes with some built-in theme options which can be explored at the Complete themes page of the ggplot2 documentation provided by tidyverse. Since we are using a scatterplot in this example, theme_bw is a simple and elegant way to display the data. Here is an example of what a theme_bw graph looks like: . #Here is the animal sleep plot we made earlier with all the ggplot2 theme_bw() added to it bw = sleep_plot + theme_bw() bw . This is a nice, clean look, with gridlines, borders, and clearly defined axes. While theme_bw does an excellent job displaying the data, there are some themes that do not lend themselves easily to scatterplots. One such theme is theme_void, shown below: . # Animal sleep plot with theme_void() from ggplot2 void = sleep_plot + theme_void() void . This theme removes all gridlines, borders, and axes, leading to a very confusing image of floating colored points and a legend. This theme is useful for geometric data, flowcharts, or other kinds of visualizations that are clearer without any axes or background. For scatterplots it is less than ideal. These are very basic themes to use, but they can clean up a graph in a pinch. However, there are other packages that contain their own prepackaged themes. A popular theming package is ggthemes. To check out multiple examples of ggthemes, visit the ALL YOUR FIGURE ARE BELONG TO US page of the official ggthemes website. And for more helpful insight into ggthemes and its arguments, visit the Introduction to ggthemes site by Jeffrey B. Arnold. While most of the ggthemes themes are great, some really stand out. One popular option is theme_tufte, which is a very minimal theme following the principles of prominent data visualization thinker Edward Tufte. Three other themes (theme_economist, theme_fivethirtyeight, and theme_wsj) all mimic the graph styles of major media/news outlets. If you really want to sell your graph and look like mainstream media, here are some examples: . # Theme following Edward Tufte tufte = sleep_plot + theme_tufte() tufte # theme_economist mimics graphs from The Economist magazine economist = sleep_plot + theme_economist() economist # theme_fivethirtyeight mimics graphs from FiveThirtyEight, a political/sports/statistics blogging site fivethirtyeight = sleep_plot + theme_fivethirtyeight() fivethirtyeight # theme_wsj mimcs graphs from The Wall Street Journal newspaper wsj = sleep_plot + theme_wsj() wsj . The data we plotted is rather simple and plain; these themes would look better on a more refined graph, one with proper names, clear positioning, and distinguished data points or lines, but these graphs still look better than the original. Another great repository of several ggplot2 themes is the hrbrthemes package. Themes in hrbrthemes change the formatting up a bit, so don’t be surprised if your axis titles move a bit. For this example, theme_modern_rc is used, as it makes the colored points of the graph pop off the screen. You can take your graph up another notch by adding one of the color options that hrbrthemes has to offer, in this case scale_color_ft: . # hrbrthemes graph with scale_color_ft and theme_modern_rc hrbr = sleep_plot + scale_color_ft() + theme_modern_rc() hrbr . There is much more that hrbrthemes has to offer beyond just theme_ functions, including other scaling options, font choices, and utilities. For more about hrbrthemes, check out the hrbrthemes page. If none of these existing themes are your cup of tea, you can try to create your own theme or modify one of those listed above to suit your tastes. To do this, you will use the theme function and include element_xx objects as arguments. Element objects that can be used are listed below: . | element_line() - can add color, linetype, and size arguments to line elements of a theme, like axis lines | element_text() - can add color, face, angle, justification, margins, and size arguments to text elements of a theme, like titles | element_rect() - can add color, fill, and size arguments to rectangular elements of a theme, like the panel window | element_blank() - can remove any element from a theme | . Please take note that customizing themes in this way will not do everything. It will not allow you to change aesthetic properties of your graph geometry, such as the different colors you assign with aes(color=). But it does allow you to make your graphs more aesthetically pleasing by changing font size or color, adding shapes around legends, and filling the backgrounds of graphs with colors and gridlines. For ways to customize your own theme in ggplot2, check out the R Graphics Cookbook by Winston Chang. Chang offers an excellent section on modifying graph themes in Chapter 9.4; at the bottom of the page is a helpful table that outlines each argument that can be used by theme, a description of what each does, and the element_xx to specify when using an argument. For a simple example of creating a theme, run the following code: . # This code modifies the legend of the graph legend = sleep_plot + theme( legend.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", color = \"dodgerblue\", size = 1), legend.title = element_text(color = \"brown\", face = \"bold\", size = 18), legend.text = element_text(color = \"brown\", face = \"bold\", size = 10), legend.key = element_rect(color = \"dodgerblue\", size = 0.5) ) legend # We use blue and brown here, as most color-blind people can distinguish these two colors # element_rect changes the box around the legend and the boxes around the colors for -vore # element_text changes the text color, size, and face within the legend . You can also modify an already existing theme using the same method as above. Here is what it looks like to modify the axis titles of the hrbrthemes graph we created earlier: . modified = hrbr + theme(axis.title.x = element_text(colour = \"yellow\", size = 12, face = \"bold\"), axis.title.y = element_text(colour = \"yellow\", size = 12, face = \"bold\")) modified . This is just scratching the surface of graph themes in R. Even more theme packages exist, like ggpubr, with the excellent publication-ready theme_pubr(), and wesanderson; these won’t be explored on this page, but if you’re interested check out this ggpubr page and this wesanderson page.

Specifically, their function is to record how frequently data values fall within pre-specified ranges called “bins.” Such visual representations can help researchers easily detect whether their data are distributed in a skewed or symmetric way, and can help detect outliers. Despite being such a popular tool for scientific research, choosing the bin width (alternatively, number of bins) is ultimately a choice by the researcher. Histograms are intended to convey information about the variable, and choosing the “right” bin size to convey the information helpfully can be something of an art. The relationship between bin width \\(h\\) and the number of bins \\(k\\) is given by: . \\[k = \\frac{ \\max x - \\min x}{h}\\] For this reason, statistical softwares such as R and Stata will often accept either custom bin width specifications, or a number of bins.

    "content": "There are many plotting libraries in Python, including declarative (say what you want) and imperative (build what you want) options. In the example below, we’ll explore several different options for plotting histogram data. By far the quickest way to plot a histogram is to use data analysis package pandas’ built-in bar chart option (which uses plotting library matplotlib). import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv(\"https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Ecdat/PSID.csv\", index_col=0) df['earnings'].plot.hist() . Note that, by default, the hist function shows counts on the y-axis. We can make this plot a bit more appealing by calling on the customisation features from matplotlib. Calling df['column-name'].plot.hist() returns a matplotlib ax object that accepts further customisation. We will use this and a style to make the plot more appealing, while also switching to show a density rather than counts, setting the number of bins explicitly, and using a logarithmic scale. import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.style.use('seaborn') ax = df['earnings'].plot.hist(density=True, log=True, bins=80) ax.set_title('Earnings in the PSID', loc='left') ax.set_ylabel('Density') ax.set_xlabel('Earnings'); . An alternative to the matplotlib-pandas combination is seaborn, a declarative plotting library. Using seaborn, we can quickly compared histograms of different cuts of the data. In the example below, a binary variable that sorts individuals into two groups based on age is added and used as the ‘hue’ of the keyword argument. import seaborn as sns age_cut_off = 45 df[f'Older than {age_cut_off}'] = df['age']&gt;age_cut_off ax = sns.histplot(df, x=\"earnings\", hue=f\"Older than {age_cut_off}\", element=\"step\", stat=\"density\") ax.set_yscale('log') . Finally, let’s look at a different declarative library, plotnine, which is inspired by (and has very similar syntax to) R’s plotting library ggplot. from plotnine import ggplot, aes, geom_histogram ( ggplot(df, aes(x='earnings', y='stat(density)') ) + geom_histogram(bins=80) ) .

However, it is also common to refer to only the excluded instruments (i.e., variables that are only used to predict the endogenous variable, not the dependent variable) as instruments. This page will follow that convention. | For instrumental variables to work, it must be the case that the instrument is only related to the outcome variable through other variables already included in the model like the endogenous variables or the controls. This is called the “validity” assumption and it cannot be verified in the data, only theoretically. Give serious consideration as to whether validity applies to your instrument before using instrumental variables. | You can check for the relevance of your instrument, which is how strongly related it is to your endogenous variable. A rule of thumb is that an joint F-test of the instruments should be at least 10, but this is only a rule of thumb, and imprecise (see Stock and Yogo 2005 for a more precise version of this test). In general, if the instruments are not very strong predictors of the endogenous variables, you should consider whether your analysis fits the assumptions necessary to run a weak-instrument-robust estimation method. See Hahn &amp; Hausman 2003 for an overview. | Instrumental variables estimates a local average treatment effect - in other words, a weighted average of each individual observation’s treatment effect, where the weights are based on the strength of the effect of the instrument on the endogenous variable. Note both that this is not the same thing as an average treatment effect, which is an average of each individual’s treatment effect, which is usually what is desired, and also that if the instrumental variable has effects of different signs for different people (non-monotonicity), then the estimate isn’t really anything of interest.

Using the + symbol allows us to add different lines of code to the same graph in order to create new elements within it. | Putting those steps together, we get the following code resulting in our first line graph: | . ggplot(tree_1_df, aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + geom_line() . This does show us how the tree grows over time, but it’s rather plain and lacks important identifying information like a title and units of measurements for the axes. In order to enhance our graph, we again use the + symbol to add additional elements like line color, titles etc. and to change things like axis labels and title/label position. | We can specify the color of our line within the geom_line() function. | The function labs() allows us to add a title and also change the labels for the axes | Using the function theme() allows us to manipulate the apperance of our labels through the element_text function | Let’s change the line color, add a title and center it, and also add more information to our axes labels. | . ggplot(tree_1_df, aes(x = age, y = circumference)) + geom_line(color = \"orange\") + labs(x = \"Age (days since 12/31/1968)\", y = \"Circumference (mm)\", title = \"Orange Tree Circumference Growth by Age\") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) . Line Graph with Multiple Lines in R . A great way to employ line graphs is to compare the changes of different values over the same time period. For this instance, we’ll be looking at how the four trees differ in their growth over time. We will be employing the full Orange dataset for this graph. To add multiple lines using data from the same dataframe, simply add the color argument to the aes() function within our ggplot() line. Set the color argument to the identifying variable within your data set, here, that variable is Tree, so we will set color = Tree. ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, y = circumference, color = Tree)) + geom_line() + labs(x = \"Age (days since 12/31/1968)\", y = \"Circumference (mm)\", title = \"Orange Tree Circumference Growth by Age\") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)) . The steps will get you started with creating graphs in R. For more information on styling your graphs, again, visit Styling Line Graphs and Line Graph with Labels at the Beginning or End of Lines.

However, for other packages this may not work, so I will also do it by hand in a way that will work with models more generally (even though we’ll still run the model in fixest): . # Interact quarter with being in the treated group clfe &lt;- feols(Rate ~ California*Quarter | State, data = od) coefplot(clfe, ref = 'Q22011') # Use broom::tidy to get the coefficients and SEs res &lt;- tidy(clfe) %&gt;% # Keep only the interactions filter(str_detect(term, ':')) %&gt;% # Pull the quarter out of the term mutate(Quarter = str_sub(term, -6)) %&gt;% # Add in the term we dropped as 0 add_row(estimate = 0, std.error = 0, Quarter = 'Q22011') %&gt;% # and add 95% confidence intervals mutate(ci_bottom = estimate - 1.96*std.error, ci_top = estimate + 1.96*std.error) %&gt;% # And put the quarters in order mutate(Quarter = factor(Quarter, levels = c('Q42010','Q12011','Q22011', 'Q32011','Q42011','Q12012'))) # And graph # \"group = 1\" is necessary to get ggplot to add the line graph # when the x-axis is a factor ggplot(res, aes(x = Quarter, y = estimate, group = 1)) + # Add points for each estimate and connect them geom_point() + geom_line() + # Add confidence intervals geom_linerange(aes(ymin = ci_bottom, ymax = ci_top)) + # Add a line so we know where 0 is geom_hline(aes(yintercept = 0), linetype = 'dashed') + # Always label! labs(caption = '95% Confidence Intervals Shown') .

There are variants of the McFadden model that relax this assumption. | If you are working with an estimation command that only allows alternative-specific predictors and not case-specific predictors, you can add them yourself by interacting the case-specific predictors with binary variables for the different alternatives.

These are your case-specific predictors. | Choice model regressions often have specific demands on how your data is structured. These vary across estimation commands and software packages. However, a common one is this (others will be pointed out in specific Implementations below): The data must contain a variable indicating the choice cases (i.e. you choose a car, that’s one case, then I choose a car, that’s a different case), a variable with the alternatives being chosen between, a binary variable equal to 1 for the alternative actually chosen (this should be 1 or TRUE exactly once within each choice case), and then variables that are case-specific or alternative-specific. | .

    "content": "Ordered probit and ordered logit are regression methods intended for use when the dependent variable is ordinal. That is, there is a natural ordering to the different (discrete) values, but no cardinal value. So we might know \\(A &gt; B\\) but not by how much \\(A\\) is greater than \\(B\\). Examples of ordinal data include responses on a Likert scale (“Very satisfied” is more satisfied than “Satisfied”, and “Satisfied” is more satisfied than “Not Satisfied”, but the difference between “Very satisfied” and “Satisfied” may not be the same as the difference between “Satisfied” and “Not Satisfied” but we may not know by how much) or education levels (a Master’s degree is more education than a Bachelor’s degree, but how much more?). When the dependent variable is ordinal, typical linear regression may not work well because it relies on absolute differences in value. Ordered probit and ordered logit take a latent-variable approach to this problem. They assume that the discrete dependent variable simply represents a continuous latent variable. In the Likert scale example this might be “satisfied-ness”. In ordered probit this latent variable is normally distributed, and in ordered logit it is distributed according to a logistic distribution. Then, the actual values just carve up the regions of that latent variable. So if satisfied-ness is distributed \\(S\\sim N(0,1)\\), then perhaps “very satisfied” is \\(S &gt; .892\\), “satisfied” is \\(.321 &lt; S \\leq .892\\), and so on. The .321 and .892 are “cutoff values” separating the categories. These cutoff values are estimated by ordered probit and ordered logit. These models assume that predictors affect the latent variable the same no matter which level you’re at. There isn’t a predictor that, for example, makes you more likely to be “satified” and less likely to be either “very satisfied” or “not satisfied” (or a predictor that has a slight positive effect going from “not satisfied” to “satisfied” but a huge effect going from “satisfied” to “very sastisfied”). You can imagine taking your ordinal variable and collapsing it into a binary one: comparing, say, “very not satisfied” and “not satisfied” as one group vs. “satisfied” and “very satisfied” as the other in a typical probit or logit. Ordered logit/probit assumes that this will give the same results as if you’d split somewhere else, comparing “very not satisfied”, “not satisfied”, and “satisfied” vs. “very satisfied”. This is the “parallel lines” or “parallel regression” assumption, or for ordered logit “proportional odds”. ",

Penalized regression eases this problem by forcing the regression estimator to shrink its coefficients towards 0 in order to avoid the “penalty” term imposed on the coefficients. This process is closely related to the idea of Bayesian shrinkage, and indeed standard penalized regression results are equivalent to regression performed using certain Bayesian priors. Regular OLS selects coefficients \\(\\hat{\\beta}\\) to minimize the sum of squared errors: . \\[\\min\\sum_i(y_i - X_i\\hat{\\beta})^2\\] Non-OLS regressions similarly select coefficients to minimize a similar objective function. Penalized regression adds a penalty term \\(\\lambda\\lVert\\beta\\rVert_p\\) to that objective function, where \\(\\lambda\\) is a tuning parameter that determines how harshly to penalize coefficients, and \\(\\lVert\\beta\\rVert_p\\) is the \\(p\\)-norm of the coefficients, or \\(\\sum_j\\lvert\\beta\\rvert^p\\). \\[\\min\\left(\\sum_i(y_i - X_i\\hat{\\beta})^2 + \\lambda\\left\\lVert\\beta\\right\\rVert_p \\right)\\] Typically \\(p\\) is set to 1 for LASSO regression (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator), which has the effect of tending to set coefficients to 0, i.e. model selection, or to 2 for Ridge Regression.

    "content": "This is an example of running penalised regressions in Python. The main takeaways are that the ubiquitous machine learning package sklearn can perform lasso, ridge, and elastic net regressions. In the example below, we’ll see all three in action. The level of penalisation will be set automatically by cross-validation, although a user may also supply the number directly. This example will use the seaborn package (for data), the patsy package (to create matrices from formulae), the matplotlib package (for plotting), the pandas package (for data manipulation), and the sklearn package (for machine learning). To run the example below, you may need to first install these packages. First, we need to import these packages for use. import seaborn as sns from patsy import dmatrices, dmatrix from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from sklearn.linear_model import LassoCV, ElasticNetCV, RidgeCV import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd . Now let’s load the data and transform it into a vector of endogeneous variables, and a matrix of exogenous variables. Using patsy, we’ll ask for all interaction variables among sepal width, petal length, and petal width (and exclude having an intercept). iris = sns.load_dataset(\"iris\") formula = (\"sepal_length ~ (sepal_width + petal_length + petal_width)**2 - 1\") y, X = dmatrices(formula, iris) . Some machine learning algorithms are more performant with data that are scaled before being used. One should be careful when scaling data if using test and training sets; here, we’re not worried about a test set though, so we just use the standard scaler (which transforms data to have 0 mean and unit standard deviation) on all of the \\(X\\) and \\(y\\) data. scale_X = StandardScaler().fit(X).transform(X) scale_y = StandardScaler().fit(y).transform(y) scale_y = scale_y.ravel() # ravel collapses a (150, 1) vector to (150,) . Now we run lasso with cross-validation. reg_lasso = LassoCV(cv=10).fit(scale_X, scale_y) . Let’s display the results so we can see for which value of \\(\\alpha\\) the lowest mean squared error occurred. Note that sklearn uses the convention that \\(\\alpha\\) (rather than \\(\\lambda\\)) is the shrinkage parameter. EPSILON = 1e-4 # This is to avoid division by zero while taking the base 10 logarithm plt.figure() plt.semilogx(reg_lasso.alphas_ + EPSILON, reg_lasso.mse_path_, ':') plt.plot(reg_lasso.alphas_ + EPSILON, reg_lasso.mse_path_.mean(axis=-1), 'k', label='Average across the folds', linewidth=2) plt.axvline(reg_lasso.alpha_ + EPSILON, linestyle='--', color='k', label=r'$\\alpha$: CV estimate') plt.legend() plt.xlabel(r'$\\alpha$') plt.ylabel('Mean square error') plt.title('Mean square error on each fold: coordinate descent ') plt.axis('tight') plt.show() .

    "title": "Regression Discontinuity Design",
    "content": "Regression discontinuity (RDD) is a research design for the purposes of causal inference. It can be used in cases where treatment is assigned based on a cutoff value of a “running variable”. For example, perhaps students in a school take a test in 8th grade. Students who score 30 or below are assigned to remedial classes, while students scoring above 30 stay in regular classes. Regression discontinuity could be applied to this setting with test score as a running variable and 30 as the cutoff to look at the effects of remedial classes. Regression discontinuity works by focusing on the cutoff. It makes an estimate of what the outcome is within a narrow bandwidth to the left of the cutoff, and also makes an estimate of what the outcome is to the right of the cutoff. Then it compares them to generate a treatment effect estimate. See Wikpedia: Regression Discontinuity Design for more information. Regression discontinuity receives a lot of attention because it relies on what some consider to be plausible assumptions. If the running variable is finely measured and is not being manipulated, then one can argue that being just to the left or the right of a cutoff is effectively random (someone getting a 30 or 31 on the test can basically be down to bad luck on the day) and so this approach by itself can remove confounding from lots of factors.

Please check the help file for your command of choice closely, and ensure you know what kind of analysis you’re about to run. Don’t assume the defaults are correct. | Regression discontinuity relies on the absence of manipulation of the running variable. In the test score example, if the teachers scoring the exam nudge a few students from 30 to 31 so they can avoid remedial classes, RDD doesn’t work any more. | Because the method relies on isolating a narrow bandwidth around the cutoff, RDD doesn’t work quite the same if the running variable is discrete and split into a small number of groups. You want a running variable with a lot of different values! See Kolesár and Rothe (2018) for more information. | In order to improve statistical performance, regression discontinuity designs often incorporate information from data points far away from the cutoff to improve the estimate of what the outcome is near the cutoff. This can be done nonparametrically, but is most often done by fitting a separate polynomial function for the running variable on either side of the cutoff. A temptation is to use a very high-order polynomial (say, \\(x, x^2, x^3, x^4\\) and \\(x^5\\)) to improve fit. However, in general a low-order polynomial is probably a better idea. See Gelman and Imbens 2019 for more information. | Regression discontinuity designs are very well-suited to graphical demonstrations of the method. Software packages designed for RDD specifically will almost always provide an easy method for creating these graphs, and it is rare that you will not want to do this. However, do keep in mind that graphs can sometimes obscure meaningfully large effects. See Kirabo Jackson for an explanation. | Regression discontinuities can be sharp, where everyone to one side of the cutoff is treated and nobody on the other side is, or fuzzy, where the probability of treatment changes across the cutoff but assignment isn’t perfect. Most RDD packages can handle both. The intuition for both is similar, but the statistical properties of sharp designs are generally stronger. Fuzzy RDD can be thought of as similar to using an instrumental variables estimator in a case of imperfect random assignment in an experiment. Covariates are generally not necessary in a sharp RDD but may be advisable in a fuzzy one. | . ",

    "content": "The most user friendly ways to use Python to reshape data from wide to long formats come from the pandas data analysis package. Its wide_to_long function is relatively easy to use, the alternative melt function can handle more complex cases. In this example, we will download the billboard dataset, which has multiple columns for different weeks when a record was in the charts (with the values in each column giving the chart position for that week). All of the columns that we would like to convert to long format begin with the prefix ‘wk’. The wide_to_long function accepts this prefix (as the stubnames= keyword parameter) and uses it to work out which columns to transform into a single column. # Install pandas using pip or conda, if you don't have it already installed import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/tidyr/billboard.csv', index_col=0) # stubnames is the prefix for the columns we want to convert to long. i is the # unique id for each row, and j will be the name of the new column. Finally, # the values from the original wide columns (the chart position) adopt the # stubname, so we rename 'wk' to 'position' in the last step. long_df = (pd.wide_to_long(df, stubnames='wk', i=['artist', 'track', 'date.entered'], j='week') .rename(columns={'wk': 'position'})) # The wide_to_long function is a special case of the 'melt' function, which # can be used in more complex cases. Here we melt any columns that have the # string 'wk' in their names. In the final step, we extract the number of weeks # from the prefix 'wk' using regex. The final dataframe is the same as above. long_df = pd.melt(df, id_vars=['artist', 'track', 'date.entered'], value_vars=[x for x in df.columns if 'wk' in x], var_name='week', value_name='position') long_df['week'] = long_df['week'].str.extract(r'(\\d+)') # A more complex case taken from the pandas docs: import numpy as np # In this case, there are two different patterns in the many columns # that we want to convert to two different long columns. We can pass # stubnames a list of these prefixes.

    "doc": "Sankey Diagrams",
    "title": "R",
    "content": "There are many excellent packages in R for making Sankey diagrams (networkD3, alluvial, and ggforce among them), but let’s begin by looking at the highcharter package. It is an R wrapper for the Highcharts Javascript library and a powerful tool. It’s also easy to get up and running quickly, while some other packages may require more preliminary data wrangling. We begin by loading pacman and dplyr. library(pacman) p_load(dplyr) . Next, we bring in the highcharter package and import a csv file that includes data from the 2020-2021 NBA season, including team, division, winning percentage, playoff seeding, and appearance in the conference semifinals. We change the winning percentage “win_perc” variable to a character so that it functions appropriately in this setting and take a look at the first few rows. p_load(highcharter) nba = read.csv(\"https://github.com/LOST-STATS/lost-stats.github.io/raw/source/Presentation/Figures/Data/Sankey_Diagrams/NBA.csv\") nba$win_perc &lt;- as.character(nba$win_perc) head(nba) . Now we simply use “data_to_sankey” within the hchart function to create our Sankey diagram. We see that the data flows in the same order as our data frame, from individual team to conference, and then from winning percentage and playoff position to whether the team made the conference semifinals. I have chosen the theme ggplot2 but there are many nice options. hchart(data_to_sankey(nba), \"sankey\", name = \"Number of teams\") %&gt;% hc_title(text= \"NBA 2020-2021 Season\") %&gt;% hc_subtitle(text= \"Team --- Conference --- Winning Percentage --- Playoff Position --- Advancement to Conference Semifinals\") %&gt;% hc_add_theme(hc_theme_ggplot2()) %&gt;% hc_plotOptions(series = list(dataLabels = list( style = list(fontSize = \"10px\")))) . Dynamically hovering the cursor over each node or branch gives us a count of how many teams went to each of the next nodes. For instance, we see that 3 teams from the West had a winning percentage of 0.4. Also, between the last two nodes we see that one top 4 seed did not advance to the conference semifinals and one 5 to 8 seed did. Next, we look at the ggalluvial package, which is an extension for the ggplot2 package. This, too, is simple to get started. In fact, the bulk of the code here is manipulating the familiar mtcars data set such that hp, wt, mpg, and qsec are made categorical from their original numeric values. This fact underscores one way the Sankey diagram is useful. Namely, that values can be essentially binned in order to see trends in data flow. We load the package and mtcars, do our data wrangling, and check out the first few rows. p_load(ggplot2, ggalluvial) data(mtcars) mtc = mtcars %&gt;% select(cyl, hp, wt, qsec, mpg) %&gt;% mutate( hp = case_when( hp &lt;= 100 ~ \"0-100\", hp &lt;= 150 ~ \"100-150\", hp &lt;= 200 ~ \"150-200\", hp &lt;= 500 ~ \"200-350\"), wt = case_when( wt &lt;= 2 ~ \"1-2\", wt &lt;= 3 ~ \"2-3\", wt &lt;= 4 ~ \"3-4\", wt &lt;= 7 ~ \"4-6\"), mpg = case_when( mpg &lt;= 20 ~ \"10-20 mpg\", mpg &lt;= 30 ~ \"20-30 mpg\", mpg &lt;= 50 ~ \"30-40 mpg\"), qsec = case_when( qsec &lt;= 16 ~ \"14-16\", qsec &lt;= 17 ~ \"16-17\", qsec &lt;= 18 ~ \"17-18\", qsec &lt;= 23 ~ \"18-23\" )) head(mtc) . Next, we use the familiar ggplot and include the line “geom_alluvium” to induce an alluvial diagram. We can interpret that weight and number of cylinders are highly correlated but that horsepower and the quarter-mile time are less so. ggplot(data = mtc, aes(axis1 = wt, axis2 = cyl, axis3 = hp, axis4 = qsec)) + scale_x_discrete(limits = c(\"Weight (1,000 lbs)\", \"Cylinders\", \"Horsepower\", \"1/4 mile time (seconds\"), expand = c(.05, .05)) + geom_alluvium(aes(fill = mpg)) + geom_stratum(color = \"grey\") + geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) + theme_minimal() + ggtitle(\"Miles per Gallon\", \"Stratified by weight, cylinders, horsepower, &amp; 1/4 mile time (n = 32 car models)\") . We see four variables (wt, cyl, hp, and qsec) in columns, with the proportion of each category represented by the height of the node. In this package, it is easier to see the distribution of each variable because columns are all the same height and frequency of categorical values is proportional. The y axis is a measure of the number of observations in our sample. Additionally, our fifth variable, mpg, is color coded in bands across the diagram, allowing us to highlight a particular aspect of this data set. These are relatively basic examples, but in a few lines of code demonstrate the usefulness of a Sankey diagram to track the flow and distribution of variables in a data set. ",

    "title": "Python",
    "content": "Five of the most well-known and powerful libraries for webscraping in Python, which between them cover a huge range of needs, are requests, lxml, beautifulsoup, selenium, and scrapy. Broadly, requests is for downloading webpages via code, beautifulsoup and lxml are for parsing webpages and extracting info, and scrapy and selenium are full web-crawling solutions. For the special case of scraping table from websites, pandas is the best option. For quick and simple webscraping of individual HTML tags, a good combo is requests, which does little more than go and grab the HTML of a webpage, and beautifulsoup, which then helps you to navigate the structure of the page and pull out what you’re actually interested in. For dynamic webpages that use javascript rather than just HTML, you’ll need selenium. To scale up and hit thousands of webpages in an efficient way, you might try scrapy, which can work with the other tools and handle multiple sessions, and all other kinds of bells and whistles… it’s actually a “web scraping framework”. Let’s see a simple example using requests and beautifulsoup, followed by an example of extracting a table using pandas. First we need to import the packages; remember you may need to install these first by running pip install packagename on your computer’s command line. import requests from bs4 import BeautifulSoup import pandas as pd . Now we’ll specify a URL to scrape, download it as a page, and show some of the HTML as downloaded (here, the first 500 characters) . url = \"https://blackopaldirect.com/product/black-opals/2-86-ct-black-opal-11-6x9-7x3-9mm/\" page = requests.get(url) print(page.text[:500]) . &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; &lt;html lang=\"en-US\"&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta charset=\"UTF-8\"&gt; &lt;meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no\"&gt; &lt;link rel=\"profile\" href=\"http://gmpg.org/xfn/11\"&gt; &lt;link rel=\"pingback\" href=\"https://blackopaldirect.com/xmlrpc.php\"&gt; &lt;!-- Facebook Pixel Code --&gt; &lt;script&gt; !function(f,b,e,v,n,t,s) {if(f.fbq)return;n=f.fbq=function(){n.callMethod? n.callMethod.apply(n,arguments):n.queue.push(arguments)}; if(!f._fbq)f._fbq=n;n.push=n;n.loaded= . That’s a bit tricky to read, let alone get any useful data out of. So let’s now use beautifulsoup, which parses extracted HTML. To pretty print the page use .text. In the example below, we’ll just show the first 100 characters and we’ll also use rstrip and lstrip to trim leading and trailing whitespace: . soup = BeautifulSoup(page.text, 'html.parser') print(soup.text[:100].lstrip().rstrip()) . 2.86 ct black opal 11.6x9.7x3.9mm - Black Opal Direct . There are lots of different elements, with tags, that make up a page of HTML. For example, a title might have a tag ‘h1’ and a class ‘product_title’. Let’s see how we can retrieve anything with a class that is ‘price’ and a tag that is ‘p’ as these are the characteristics of prices displayed on the URL we are scraping. price_html = soup.find(\"p\", {\"class\": \"price\"}) print(price_html) . &lt;p class=\"price\"&gt;&lt;span class=\"woocommerce-Price-amount amount\"&gt;&lt;bdi&gt;&lt;span class=\"woocommerce-Price-currencySymbol\"&gt;US$&lt;/span&gt;2,500.00&lt;/bdi&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; . This returns the first tag found that satisfies the conditions (to get all tags matching the criteria use soup.find_all). To extract the value, just use .text: . price_html.text . 'US$2,500.00' . Now let’s see an example of reading in a whole table of data. For this, we’ll use pandas, the ubiquitous Python library for working with data. We will read data from the first table on ‘https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup’ using pandas. The function we’ll use is read_html, which returns a list of dataframes of all the tables it finds when you pass it a URL. If you want to filter the list of tables, use the match= keyword argument with text that only appears in the table(s) you’re interested in. The example below shows how this works; looking at the website, we can see that the table we’re interested in (of past world cup results), has a ‘fourth place’ column while other tables on the page do not. Therefore we run: . df_list = pd.read_html('https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_World_Cup', match='Fourth Place') # Retrieve first and only entry from list of dataframes df = df_list[0] df.head() . | | Year | Host | Winner | Score | Runners-up | Third Place | Score.1 | Fourth Place | . | 0 | 1930 Details | Uruguay | Uruguay | 4 - 2 | Argentina | United States | [note 1] | Yugoslavia | . | 1 | 1934 Details | Italy | Italy | 2 - 1(a.e.t.) | Czechoslovakia | Germany | 3 - 2 | Austria | . | 2 | 1938 Details | France | Italy | 4 - 2 | Hungary | Brazil | 4 - 2 | Sweden | . | 3 | 1950 Details | Brazil | Uruguay | [note 2] | Brazil | Sweden | [note 2] | Spain | . | 4 | 1954 Details | Switzerland | West Germany | 3 - 2 | Hungary | Austria | 3 - 1 | Uruguay | . This delivers the table neatly loaded into a pandas dataframe ready for further use. ",

This skill allows you to take data from different types of spatial data (vector data like points, lines, and polygons, and raster data (with a little more work)) sets and merge them together using unique identifiers. Joins are typically interesections of objects, but can be expressed in different ways. These include: equals, covers, covered by, within, touches, near, crosses, and more. These are all functions within the sf function in R or the geopandas package in Python. For more on the different types of intersections in 2D projections, see the Wikipedia page on spatial relations. ",

Now that there are polygons established and identified, we can add in some point data to join to our currently existing polygon data and do some analysis with it. To do this we will use the Global Surface Summary of the Day (gsodr) package for climate data. We will take the metadata from the GSODR package via ‘isd_history’, make it spatial data, then filter out only those observations in our candidate states of Oregon, Ohio, and Michigan. load(system.file(\"extdata\", \"isd_history.rda\", package = \"GSODR\")) #We want this to be spatial data isd_history &lt;- as.data.frame(isd_history) %&gt;% st_as_sf(coords=c(\"LON\",\"LAT\"), crs=4326, remove=FALSE) #There are many observations, so we want to narrow it to our three candidate states isd_history_or &lt;- dplyr::filter(isd_history, CTRY==\"US\", STATE==\"OR\") isd_history_oh &lt;- dplyr::filter(isd_history, CTRY==\"US\", STATE==\"OH\") isd_history_mi &lt;- dplyr::filter(isd_history, CTRY==\"US\", STATE==\"MI\") . This filtering should take you from around 26,700 observation sites around the world to approximately 200 in Michigan, 85 in Ohio, and 100 in Oregon. These numbers may vary based on when you independently do your analysis. Let’s see these stations plotted in each state individually: . Note: the codes in the ‘border’ and ‘bg’ identifiers are from the viridis package. You can get some awesome color scales using that package. You can also use standard names.

We see how we can filter out polygons from attributes or intersecting relationships with points, but what if we want to merge data from the points into the polygon or vice versa? . We will use the data set for Oregon for the join example. Notice in our point dataset that there are no county names. Only station/city names. Let us join the county polygons with the climate station points and add the county names to the station data. We do this using the st_join function, which comes from the sf package. isd_or_co_pts &lt;- st_join(isd_history, left = FALSE, or_co[\"name\"]) #Rename the county name variable county instead of name, since we already have NAME for the station location colnames(isd_or_co_pts)[which(names(isd_or_co_pts) == \"name\")] &lt;- \"county\" plot(isd_or_co_pts$geometry, pch=21, cex=0.7, col=\"black\", bg=\"orange\") plot(or_co$geometry, border=\"gray\", col=NA, add=T) . You now have successfully joined the county name data into your new point data set! Those points in the plot now contain the county information for data analysis purposes. You can join in any attribute you would like, or by leaving it as: . isd_or_co_pts &lt;- st_join(isd_history, left = FALSE, or_co) . You add all attributes from the polygon into the point data frame! . Also note that st_join is the default function that joins any type of intersection. You can be more precise our particular about your conditions with the other spatial joins: . st_within only joins elements that are completely within the defined area . st_equal only joins elements that are spatially equal. Meaning that A is within B and B is within A. You can use these to pare down your selections and joins to specific relationships. Good luck with your geospatial analysis! . ",

    "content": "When we use multiple explanatory variables to perform regression analysis on a dependent variable, there is a possibility that the problem of multicollinearity will occur. However, multiple linear regression requires that the correlation between the independent variables is not too high, so there is value in a method to eliminate multicollinearity and select the “optimal” regression equation. Stepwise regression is one approach to this. It can automatically help us retain the most important explanatory variables and remove relatively unimportant variables from the model. The idea of stepwise regression is to introduce independent variables one by one, and after each independent variable is introduced, the selected variables are tested one by one. If the originally introduced variable is no longer significant due to the introduction of subsequent variables, then delete it. Repeat this process until the regression equation does not introduce insignificant independent variables and does not remove significant independent variables, then the optimal regression equation can be obtained.

    "content": "In Stata, one can create plot lines using the command line, which in combination with twoway allows you to modify components of sub-plots individually. In this demonstration, I will use minimal formatting, but will apply minimal modifications using Ben Jann’s grstyle. ** Setup: Install grstyle ssc install grstyle grstyle init grstyle color background white grstyle set legend, nobox . Setup . First, you need to load the data into Stata. The data is a copy from the data economics available within ggplot package, and translated using foreign. use https://friosavila.github.io/playingwithstata/rnd_dta/economics, clear ** Since this was taken directly from R, the date variable will not be formatted. ** We can format the date using the following. format date %tdCCYY ** This indicates to create a _mask_, to put on top of \"data\" ** but only display the \"year\" . Simple line plot . Now, For a simple plot, we could use the following syntax: . line yvar1 [yvar2 yvar3 ...] xvar1 . This requests plotting all variables yvarX against xvar1 (horizontal axis). Internally, the command connects every pair of data [yvar1,xvar1] sequentially, based on the order they appear in the dataset. Below, we can do that, plotting unemployment duration uempmed vs date. line uempmed date . Something to keep in mind. If the dataset is not sorted by date, you may end up with a lineplot that is all over the place. For example: . sort uempmed line uempmed date . To avoid this, it is recommended to use the option sort. line uempmed date, sort . Adding titles, and axis titles . The next thing you may want to do is add information to the plot, so its easier to understand what the figure is showing. Specifically, we can add information on the vertical axis using ytitle(). I will also use xtitle() to drop the horizontal axis information, and add a title title(). line uempmed date, sort /// ytitle(\"# of weeks\") xtitle(\"\") /// title(Unemployment Duration) . Changing Line characteristics. It is also possible to modify the line width lwidth(), line color lcolor(), and line pattern lpattern(). To show how this can affect the plot, below 4 examples are provided. Notice that each plot is saved in memory using name(), and all are combined using graph combine. line uempmed date, sort /// ytitle(\"# of weeks\") xtitle(\"\") /// title(Unemployment Duration 1) /// lwidth(.5) lcolor(red) lpattern(solid) name(m1,replace) line uempmed date, sort /// ytitle(\"# of weeks\") xtitle(\"\") /// title(Unemployment Duration 2) /// lwidth(.25) lcolor(gold) lpattern(dash) name(m2,replace) line uempmed date, sort /// ytitle(\"# of weeks\") xtitle(\"\") /// title(Unemployment Duration 3) /// lwidth(1) lcolor(\"68 170 153\") lpattern(dot) name(m3,replace) line uempmed date, sort /// ytitle(\"# of weeks\") xtitle(\"\") /// title(Unemployment Duration 4) /// lwidth(.5) lcolor(navy%50) lpattern(dash_dot) name(m4,replace) graph combine m1 m2 m3 m4 . Ploting Multiple Lines, and different axis . You may also want to plot multiple variables in the same figure. There are two ways to do this: . twoway (line uempmed date, sort lwidth(.75) lpattern(solid) ) /// (line psavert date, sort lwidth(.25) lpattern(dash) ), /// legend (order(1 \"Unemployment duration\" 2 \"Saving rate\")) line uempmed psavert date, sort lwidth(0.75 .25) lpattern(solid dash) /// legend(order(1 \"Unemployment duration\" 2 \"Saving rate\")) . Both options provide the same figure, however, I prefer the first option since that allows for more flexibility. You can also choose to plot each variable in a different axis. Each axis can have its own title. twoway (line uempmed date, sort lwidth(.75) lpattern(solid) yaxis(1)) /// (line psavert date, sort lwidth(.25) lpattern(dash) yaxis(2)), /// legend(order(1 \"Unemployment duration\" 2 \"Saving rate\")) /// ytitle(Weeks ,axis(1) ) ytitle(Interest rate,axis(2) ) . Adding informative Vertical lines. Finally, it is possible to add vertical lines. This may be useful, for example, to differentiate the great recession period. Additionally, in this plot, I add a note. twoway (line uempmed date, sort lwidth(.75) lpattern(solid) yaxis(1)) /// (line psavert date, sort lwidth(.25) lpattern(dash) yaxis(2)), /// legend(order(1 \"Unemployment duration\" 2 \"Saving rate\")) /// ytitle(Weeks ,axis(1) ) ytitle(Interest rate,axis(2) ) /// xline(`=td(1dec2007)'/`=td(30jun2008)', lcolor(gs8)) /// note(\"Note:Grey Area marks the Great recession Period\") /// title(\"Unemployement Duration and\" \"Saving Rate\") .

    "content": "A support vector machine (hereinafter, SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm in that it is trained by a set of data and then classifies any new input data depending on what it learned during the training phase. SVM can be used both for classification and regression problems but here we focus on its use for classification. The idea is to separate two distinct groups by maximizing the distance between those points that are most hard to classify. To put it more formally, it maximizes the distance or margin between support vectors around the separating hyperplane. Support vectors here imply the data points that lie closest to the hyperplane. Hyperplanes are decision boundaries that are represented by a line (in two dimensional space) or a plane (in three dimensional space) that separate the two groups. Suppose a hypothetical problem of classifying apples from lemons. Support vectors in this case are apples that look closest to lemons and lemons that look closest to apples. They are the most difficult ones to classify. SVM draws a separating line or hyperplane that maximizes the distance or margin between support vectors, in this case the apples that look closest to the lemons and lemons that look closest to apples. Therefore support vectors are critical in determining the position as well as the slope of the hyperplane.

This could then be rewritten as minimizing \\(\\lVert w \\rVert\\), or minimizing a monotonic transformation version of it expressed as \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\lVert w \\rVert^2\\). Additional constraint of \\(y_i(w^T x_i + b) \\geq 1\\) needs to be imposed to ensure that the data points are still correctly classified. As such, the constrained optimization problem for SVM looks as the following: | . \\[\\text{min} \\frac{\\lVert w \\rVert ^2}{2}\\] s.t. \\(y_i(w^T x_i + b) \\geq 1\\), . where \\(w\\) is a weight vector, \\(x_i\\) is each data point, \\(b\\) is bias, and \\(y_i\\) is each data point’s corresponding label that takes the value of either \\(\\{-1, 1\\}\\). For detailed information about derivation of the optimization problem, refer to MIT presentation slides, The Math Behind Support Vector Machines, and Demystifying Maths of SVM - Part1. | If data points are not linearly separable, non-linear SVM introduces higher dimensional space that projects data points from original finite-dimensional space to gain linearly separation.

    "content": "Synthetic Control Method is a way of estimating the causal effect of an intervention in comparative case studies. It is typically used with a small number of large units (e.g. countries, states, counties) to estimate the effects of aggregate interventions. The idea is to construct a convex combination of similar untreated units (often referred to as the “donor pool”) to create a synthetic control that closely resembles the treatment subject and conduct counterfactual analysis with it. We have \\(j = 1, 2, ..., J+1\\) units, assuming without loss of generality that the first unit is the treated unit, \\(Y_{1t}\\). Denoting the potential outcome without intervention as \\(Y_{1t}^N\\), our goal is to estimate the treatment effect: . \\[\\tau_{1t} = Y_{1t} - Y_{1t}^N\\] We won’t have data for \\(Y_{1t}^N\\) but we can use synthetic controls to estimate it. Let the \\(k\\) x \\(J\\) matrix \\(X_0 = [X_2 ... X_{J+1}]\\) represent characteristics for the untreated units and the \\(k\\)-length vector \\(X_1\\) represent characteristics for the treatment unit. Last, define our \\(J\\times 1\\) vector of weights as \\(W = (w_2, ..., w_{J+1})'\\). Recall, these weights are used to form a convex combination of the untreated units. Now we have our estimate for the treatment effect: . \\[\\hat{\\tau_{1t}} = Y_{1t} - \\hat{Y_{1t}^N}\\] where \\(\\hat{Y_{1t}^N} = \\sum_{j=2}^{J+1} w_j Y_{jt}\\). The matrix of weights is found by choosing \\(W*\\) to minimize \\(\\|X_1 - X_0W\\|\\) such that \\(W &gt;&gt; 0\\) and \\(\\sum_2^{J+2} w_j = 1\\). Once you’ve found the \\(W*\\), you can put together an estimated \\(\\hat{Y_{1t}}\\) (synthetic control) for all time periods \\(t\\). Because our synthetic control was constructed from untreated units, when the intervention occurs at time \\(T_0\\), the difference between the synthetic control and the treated unit gives us our estimated treatment effect. As a last bit of intuition, below is a graph depicting the upshot of the method. The synthetic control follows a very similar path to the treated unit pre-intervention. The difference between the two curves, post-intervention, gives us our estimated treatment effect. Here is an excellent resource by Alberto Abadie (the economist who developed the method) if you’re interested in getting a more comprehensive overview of synthetic controls. ",

However, the donor pool must still share similar characteristics to the treatment unit in order to construct an accurate estimate. | Panel data is necessary for the synthetic control method and, typically, requires observations over many time periods. Specifically, the pre-intervention time frame ought to be large enough to form an accurate estimate. | Aggregate data is required for this method. Examples include state-level per-capita GDP, country-level crime rates, and state-level alcohol consumption statistics. Additionally, if aggregate data doesn’t exist, you can sometimes aggregate micro-level data to estimate aggregate values. | As a caveat to the previous bullet point, be wary of structural breaks when using large pre-intervention periods. | Abadie and L’Hour (2020) also proposes a penalization method for performing the synthetic control method on disaggregated data. | .

    "content": "You’ll need: . | A Github account and some familiarity with git | A program that can be run on the command line that accomplishes your data gathering task | The requirements for that program enumerated in one of several standard ways | . For the rest of this section, we’ll focus a bit on requirements (2) and (3). Requirement (2): A command line program . What you’ll be able to tell Github to do is run a series of commands. It is best to package these up into one command that will do everything for you. For instance, if you’re using python, you will probably want to have a file called main.py that looks something like this: . import csv import sys from datetime import datetime from typing import List, Union import requests URL = \"https://whereveryourdatais.com/\" def process_page(html: str) -&gt; List[List[Union[int, str]]]: \"\"\" This is the meat of your web scraper: Pulling out the data you want from the HTML of the web page \"\"\" def pull_data(url: str) -&gt; List[List[Union[int, str]]]: resp = requests.get(url) resp.raise_for_status() content = resp.content.decode('utf8') return process_page(content) def main(): # The program takes 1 optional argument: an output filename.

Here the meat of your web scraper goes into the pull_data and the process_page functions. These are then wrapped into the main function which you can call on the command line as: . python3 main.py . Similarly, if you’re using R, you’ll want to create a main.R file to similar effect. For instance, it might look something like: . library(readr) library(httr) URL &lt;- \"https://whereveryourdatais.com/\" #' This hte meat of your web scraper: #' Pulling out the data you want from the HTML of the web page process_page &lt;- function(html) { # Process html } #' Pull data from a single URL and return a tibble with it nice and ordered pull_data &lt;- function(url) { resp &lt;- GET(url) if (resp$status_code &gt;= 400) { stop(paste0(\"Something bad occurred in trying to pull \", URL)) } return(process_page(content(resp))) } main &lt;- function() { # The program takes 1 optional argument: an output filename. If not present, # we will write the output a default filename, which is: date &lt;- Sys.time() attr(date, \"tzone\") &lt;- \"UTC\" filename &lt;- paste0(\"data/output-\", as.Date(date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")) args &lt;- commandArgs(trailingOnly = TRUE) if (length(args) &gt; 0) { filename &lt;- args[1] } print(paste0(\"Will write data to \", filename)) print(paste0(\"Pulling data from \", URL)) data &lt;- pull_data(URL) print(\"Done pulling data\") print(\"Writing data...\") write_csv(data, filename) print(\"Done writing data.\") } . Here the meat of your web scraper goes into the pull_data and the process_page functions. These are then wrapped into the main function which you can call on the command line as (note the --vanilla): . Rscript --vanilla main.R . Requirement (3): Enumerated lists of requirements . In order for Github to run your command, it will need to know what dependencies it needs to install. For experts, using a tool like poetry in Python or renv in R is probably what you actually want to do. However, for the purposes of this article, we’ll stick to a simple list. As such, you should create a file entitled requirements.txt in your project’s main folder. In this you should list, one requirement per line, the requirements of your script. For instance, in the python example above, your requirements.txt should look like . requests . The R example should have . httr readr . If you’re using R, you’ll also need to add the following script in a file called install.R to your project: . CRAN &lt;- \"https://mirror.las.iastate.edu/CRAN/\" process_file &lt;- function(filepath) { con &lt;- file(filepath, \"r\") while (TRUE) { line &lt;- trimws(readLines(con, n = 1)) if (length(line) == 0) { break } install.packages(line, repos = CRAN) } close(con) } process_file(\"requirements.txt\") .

If you’re using R, you’ll also have an install.R script present. With that, we move to setting up the Github Action! . In this section, we assume that your repository is already on Github. Throughout, we’ll assume that the repository is hosted at USERNAME/REPO, e.g., lost-stats/lost-stats.github.io. Telling it to run . Now you just need to add a file called .github/workflows/schedule.yml to your repo. Its contents should look like this: . name: Run scheduled action on: schedule: # You need to set your schedule here - cron: CRON_SCHEDULE jobs: pull_data: runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 steps: - name: Checkout code uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: persist-credentials: false fetch-depth: 0 # If using Python: - name: Set up Python 3.8 uses: actions/setup-python@v2 with: python-version: \"3.8\" # If using R: - name: Set up R 4.0.3 uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v1 with: r-version: \"4.0.3\" # If using Python: - name: Install dependencies run: pip install -r requirements.txt # If using R: - name: Install dependencies run: Rscript --vanilla install.R # If using Python: - name: Pull data run: python3 main.py # If using R: - name: Pull data run: Rscript --vanilla main.R # NOTE: This commits everything in the `data` directory.

You’ll need to edit this file and retain only the stanzas that pertain to whether you’re using Python or R. However, you’ll need to make a few adjustments. Let’s go through the file stanza by stanza to explain what it is doing: . name: Run scheduled action . This is just a descriptive name. Everything after the : is decorative. Name it whatever you like! . on: . This section describes when the action should run. Github actions supports several potential events, including push, pull_request, and repository_dispatch. However, since this is a scheduled action, we’re going to use the schedule event. The next line - cron: CRON_SCHEDULE tells Github how frequently to run the action. You need to replace CRON_SCHEDULE with your preferred frequency. You need to write this in “cron syntax,” which is an arcane but pretty universally recognized format for specifying event schedules. I recommend using a helper like this one to write this expression. For instance, let’s say we want to run this job at noon UTC every day. Then this line should become - cron: \"0 12 * * *\". jobs: . This tells us that we’re about to begin specifying the list of jobs to be run on the schedule described above. pull_data: . This is also just a descriptive name. It is best that it follow snake_casing, in particular, it should have no spaces or strange characters. runs-on: ubuntu-20.04 . This specifies which operating system to run your code on. Github supports a lot of choices, but generally, ubuntu-20.04 or ubuntu-latest is what you’ll want. steps: . In what follows, we list out the individual steps Github should take. Each step consists of several components: . | name: A descriptive name. Can be anything you’d like. It’s also optional, but I find it useful. | uses: Optionally reference an series of steps somebody else has already specified. | with: If using uses:, specificy any variables in calling that action. | run: Just simply run a (series of) commands in the shell, one per line. | env: Specify envrionment variables for use in the shell. | . We’ll see several examples of this below. Checkout code . This stanza tells the action to checkout this repository’s code. This will begin basically every Github action you build. Note that it uses: a standard action that is maintained by Github itself. Setup Python or R . These are actions that tell Github to make a specific version of Python or R available in your envrionment. You probably only need one, but you can use both if you need. Specify the exact version you want in the with: section. Install dependencies . This runs a script that installs all the dependencies you enumerated earlier in requirements.txt. Python comes with a built in dependency manager called pip, so we just point it to our list of dependencies. On the other hand, we tell R to execute our dependency installation script install.R. In either case, we’re using run: as we’re telling Github to execute a command in its own shell. Pull data . This is the task we’re actually going to run! Note that we’re calling either the main.py or main.R file we built before. After this is done, we assume there will be a new file in the data/ directory. Git commit . This stanza commits the new data to this repository and sets up the required git variables. Note that here we’re using run: |. In YAML, ending a line with | indicates that all the following lines that are at the same tab depth should be used as a single value. So here, we’re telling Github to run the commands, git add data, git config --local user.email \"action@github.com\", etc in order. Git push . This pushes the commit back up to the repository using git push. Note that if the name of your main branch is not main (for instance, it may be master), you will need to change HEAD:main to whatever your main branch is called (e.g., HEAD:master). Also note that we are setting an environment variable here. Specfically, in the env: section we’re setting the TOKEN environment variable to ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}. This is a a special value that Github generates for each run of your action that allows your action to manipulate its own repository. In this case, it’s allowing it to push a commit back to the central repository. ",

For instance, you may want to scrape weather data every hour to build an archive for later analysis. Or perhaps you want to perform the same statistical analyses each week on new data as it comes in. In our experience, this is the worst kind of tasks for humans to do: They have to reliably remember to run a piece of code at a specified time, aggregate the results in a consistent format, and then walk away.

Perhaps the measurement tools only detect at a minimum threashold or up until some maximum threshold, or there’s a physical limitation or natural constraint that cuts off the range of outcomes. If the dependent variable has a limited range in any way, then an OLS regression will capture the relationship between variables with a cluster of zeros or maximums distorting the relationship. James Tobin’s big idea was essentially to modify the likelihood function to represent the unequal sampling probability of observations depending if a latent dependent variable is smaller than or larger than that range. The Tobit model is also called a Censored Regression Model for this reason, as it allows flexility to account of either left or right side censorship. There is flexibility in the mathematics depending on how the censoring occurs.

If all observations are observed in “X” but the true value of “Y” isn’t known outside some range, then it is Censored. At the Chernobyl disaster the radioactive isotope meter only read up until a maximum threshold, all areas (“X”) are observed but the true value of the radioactive level (“Y”) is right censored at a maximum. When there is not a full set of “X” observed, then data is truncated, or in other words, a censored Y value does not get it’s input x observed thus the set {Y,X} is not complete. For more info try these UH slides from Bauer School of Business (they also have relatively easily digestable theory). | The Tobit model type I (the main one people are talking about without specification) is really a morphed maximum likelihood estimation of a probit, more background from those links. | If you find yourself needing non-parametric form, you will need to use a CLAD operator as well as new variance estimation techniques, I recommend Bruce Hansen’s from University of Wisconsin, notes here. | .

Many difference-in-difference applications instead use many groups, and treatments that are implemented at different times (a “rollout” design). Traditionally these models have been estimated using fixed effects for group and time period, i.e. “two-way” fixed effects. However, this approach with difference-in-difference can heavily bias results if treatment effects differ across groups, and alternate estimators are preferred.

So we measure the how the murder rate changes from before 2014 to after between legalized states and states without legalization.

Step 2: . Notice that the data has already been collapsed to the treated-year level. That is, there is one observation of the murder rate for each year for the treated states (all averaged together), and one observation of the murder rate for each year for the untreated states (all averaged together). We create the indicator variable called after to indicate whether it is in the treated period of being after the year of 2014 (1), or the before period of between 2000-2013 (0). The variable treat indicates that the state legalizes marijuana in 2014. Notice that treat = 1 in these states even before 2014. If the year is after 2014 and the state decided to legalize marijuana, the indicator variable “treatafter” is “1” . DiD &lt;- DiD %&gt;% mutate(after = year &gt;= 2014) %&gt;% mutate(treatafter = after*treat) . Step 3: . Then we need to plot the graph to visualize the impact of legalize marijuana on murder rate by using ggplot. mt &lt;- ggplot(DiD,aes(x=year, y=murder, color = treat)) + geom_point(size=3)+geom_line() + geom_vline(xintercept=2014,lty=4) + labs(title=\"Murder and Time\", x=\"Year\", y=\"Murder Rate\") mt . It looks like, before the legalization occurred, murder rates in treated and untreated states were very similar, lending plausibility to the parallel trends assumption. Step 4: . We need to measure the impact of impact of legalize marijuana. If we include treat, after, and treatafter in a regression, the coefficient on treatafter can be interpreted as “how much bigger was the before-after difference for the treated group?” which is the DiD estimate. reg&lt;-lm(murder ~ treat+treatafter+after, data = DiD) summary(reg) . After legalization, the murder rate dropped by 0.3% more in treated than untreated states, suggesting that legalization reduced the murder rate. ",

LOST is a publicly-editable website with the goal of making it easy to execute statistical techniques in statistical software. Each page of the website contains a statistical technique &mdash; which may be an estimation method, a data manipulation or cleaning method, a method for presenting or visualizing results, or any of the other kinds of things that statistical software typically does. For each of those techniques, the LOST page will contain code for performing that method in a variety of packages and languages. It may also contain information (or links) with thorough descriptions of the method, but the focus here is on implementation. How can you do it in your language of choice? If there are multiple ways, how are those ways different? Is the way you used to do it outdated, or does it do something unexpected? What's the `R` equivalent of that command you know about in `Stata` or `SAS`, or vice versa? In short, LOST is a Rosetta Stone for statistical software.
