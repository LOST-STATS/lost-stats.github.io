# Desired Nonexistent Pages

This is a manually-maintained list of pages that have been linked from elsewhere, or that it would be nice to have, but do not exist yet. Feel free to edit with your own wishes! Also look **below** for a list of pages that exist but only have one language, and so could use some expanding.

**A page does not have to be listed here for you to add it!** These are just the things that we *thought of*. There's certainly plenty more in the world of statistical techniques to be added.

If you create one of these pages, please remove it from this list.

## Data Manipulation


## Geo-Spatial

* Handling Raster Data
* Handling Vector Data
* Spatial Moving Average Model

## Model Estimation

### OLS

### GLS

* Nonlinear Instrumental Variables Estimation
* Nonparametric regression
* Tobit
* Ordered Probit
* Ordered Logit
* Conditional Logit
* Endogenous Switching Model
* Nonparametric Sample Selection Models
* Treatment Effect Model

### Multilevel Models

* Hierarchical Bayes Conditional Logit

### Matching

* Nearest-Neighbor Distance Matching

* Event Study Estimation

### Statistical Inference

* Average Marginal Effects
* Marginal Effects at the Mean
* Nonlinear hypothesis tests
* Non-Standard Bootstrap Standard Errors (bootstrap standard errors that aren't built in to the command and must be done "by hand", i.e. for matching)

#### Nonstandard Errors

* Cluster Bootstrap Standard Errors
* Jackknife Standard Errors

## Machine Learning 

* A-B Testing
* Artificial Neural Networks

## Presentation

### Figures

## Other

* Import a Fixed-Width Data File

* Power Analysis of Interaction Terms

# List of One-Language Pages

This is a list of pages that exist but only have an example in one language, and so are ripe for expanding. Easy contributions, too, since the outline of the page is already written, and you can (should) use the same data as in the example already provided.

## Currently Python Only

* Machine Learning: [K-Nearest Neighbor Matching]({{ "/Machine_Learning/Nearest_Neighbor.html" | relative_url }})
* Machine Learning: [Artificial Neural Network]({{ "/Machine_Learning/artificial_neural_network.html" | relative_url }})

## Currently R Only

* Geospatial: [Merging Shape Files]({{ "/Geo-Spatial/merging_shape_files.html" | relative_url }})
* Model Estimation: [Mixed Logit Model]({{ "/Model_Estimation/Multilevel_Models/mixed_logit.html" | relative_url }})
* Model Estimation: [2x2 Difference-in-Differences]({{ "/Model_Estimation/Research_Design/two_by_two_difference_in_difference.html" | relative_url }})
* Model Estimation: [Stepwise Regression]({{ "/Model_Estimation/OLS/stepwise_regression.html" | relative_url }})
* Model Estimation: [Propensity Score Matching]({{ "Model_Estimation/Matching/propensity_score_matching.html" | relative_url }})
* Presentation: [Styling Line Graphs]({{ "/Presentation/Figures/styling_line_graphs.html" | relative_url }})
* Time Series: [ARIMA]({{ "/Time_Series/ARIMA-models.html" | relative_url }})
* Time Series: [Granger Causality]({{ "/Time_Series/Granger_Causality.html" | relative_url }})
* Time Series: [MA Models]({{ "/Time_Series/MA_Model.html" | relative_url }})
* Time Series: [Linear Gaussian State Space Models]({{ "/Time_Series/State_Space_Models.html" | relative_url }})
* Other: [Simple Web Scraping]({{"Other/simple_web_scrape.html" | relative_url }}) - this one is also R-centric in the intro, please change that when you add another language!
