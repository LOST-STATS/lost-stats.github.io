# Desired Nonexistent Pages

This is a manually-maintained list of pages that have been linked from elsewhere, or that it would be nice to have, but do not exist yet. Feel free to edit with your own wishes! Also look **below** for a list of pages that exist but only have one language, and so could use some expanding.

**A page does not have to be listed here for you to add it!** These are just the things that we *thought of*. There's certainly plenty more in the world of statistical techniques to be added.

If you create one of these pages, please remove it from this list.

## Data Manipulation

* Regular Expressions

## Geo-Spatial

* Handling Raster Data
* Handling Vector Data
* Spatial Moving Average Model

## Model Estimation

### OLS

### GLS

* Nonlinear Instrumental Variables Estimation

## Machine Learning 

* A-B Testing
* Artificial Neural Networks

## Presentation

### Figures

* Export Data to a Foreign Format
* Set a Working Directory
* Power Analysis of Interaction Terms

# List of One-Language Pages

This is a list of pages that exist but only have an example in one language, and so are ripe for expanding. Easy contributions, too, since the outline of the page is already written, and you can (should) use the same data as in the example already provided.
