## Intergrating 0.01*0.01 resolution nc file to a municipality level shp file

When we work with spatial econometrics anaylsis, it is quite often we need to deal with data in different format and at different scales. For example, I have nc data with global pm2.5 estimation with 0.01*0.01 resolution. But I want to see the pm2.5 estimation in municipal level. Then I need to integrate my nc file into my municipality shp file so that I can group by the data into municipal level and calculate the mean. Then, I can make a map of it.\

In this example, I will use Brazil's pm2.5 estimation and its shp file in municipal level.


```{r load the required packages}
library(ncdf4)
library(sp)
library(raster)
library(dplyr)
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(reprex)
```

## Keep in Mind
1. Make sure to download sf package.\
2. It doesn't have to be nc file to map into the shp file, any format that can read in and convert to a sf object works. But the data has to have geometry coordinates(longitude and latitude).


##Implementation

**R**

*Step 1: Read in nc file as a dataframe*\

```{r readin nc file}

nc = here::here("Geo-Spatial/Data/GlobalGWRwUni_PM25_GL_201001_201012-RH35_Median_NoDust_NoSalt.nc")

pm2010 = nc_open(nc)

nc.brick = brick("Data/GlobalGWRwUni_PM25_GL_201001_201012-RH35_Median_NoDust_NoSalt.nc")

dim(nc.brick)

nc.df = as.data.frame(nc.brick[[1]], xy = T)

head(nc.df)
```

*Step 2: Filter out a specifc country.*\

Globle data is very big. Now I am gonna filter only Brazil out. Then remove the global data to free up the rams.\

```{r filter Brazil}
nc.brazil = nc.df %>% filter(x >= -73.59 & x <= 34.47 & y >= -33.45 & y <= 5.16)
rm(nc.df)
head(nc.brazil)
```

*Step 3: Change the dataframe to a sf object.*\

```{r sf, echo=FALSE}
pm25_sf = st_as_sf(nc.brazil, coords = c("x", "y"), crs = 4326, agr = "constant")
rm(nc.brazil)
head(pm25_sf)
```

*Step 4: Read in the Brazil shp file.*\

```{r shp file}
Brazil_map_2010 = st_read(here::here("Geo-Spatial/Data/geo2_br2010/geo2_br2010.shp"))
head(Brazil_map_2010)
```

*Step 5: Intersect pm25 sf object with the shp file.*

Now let's use a sample from pm25 data and intersect it with the shp file. Since the sf object is huge, I recommend run it on the google cloud engine for the whole country's geometry points.\

```{r sf_intersection}
pm25_sample = sample_n(pm25_sf, 1000, replace = FALSE)
pm25_municipal_2010 = st_intersection(pm25_sample, Brazil_map_2010)
head(pm25_municipal_2010)
```

*Step 6: Make a map for this 183 municipals.*\

```{r map}
pm25_municipal_2010 = pm25_municipal_2010 %>%
  select(1,6)
pm25_municipal_2010 = st_drop_geometry(pm25_municipal_2010)
Brazil_pm25_2010 = left_join(Brazil_map_2010, pm25_municipal_2010)
ggplot(Brazil_pm25_2010) +
  geom_sf(aes(fill = -layer), alpha=0.8, lwd = 0, col="white") +
  scale_fill_viridis_c(option = "viridis", name = "PM25") +
  ggtitle("PM25 in municipals of Brazil")+
  ggsn::blank()
```
